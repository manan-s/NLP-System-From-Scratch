A Brief History of Point Breeze: Home of the Fricks
The Frick is located in the East End of Pittsburgh in a neighborhood called Point Breeze. Named after an early 19th-century hotel, Point Breeze was host to some of the wealthiest families in Pittsburgh and the entire United States. Andrew Mellon, George Westinghouse, Henry Clay Frick, and Henry John Heinz all had their estates located along Penn Avenue. In stark contrast to its appearance today, the neighborhood was largely undeveloped until the early twentieth century. At that time, for both social and economic reasons, many of the wealthy families sold their properties, which were divided up into smaller plots of land.

When Point Breeze lost many of its wealthy residents, it acquired a new demographic: midde class families looking for a place to build homes and start a community. Smaller houses were built on the divvied up plots of land, the layout of the neighborhood changed, and dirt streets were paved.

The homes of Westinghouse, Heinz, and Mellon were torn down. The home of H.L. Rook, located across Homewood Avenue from Clayton, remains, but has since been divided into apartments. Large mansions became an endangered species, and soon only Clayton would be left, a lone monument to the tycoons that called Point Breeze their home.
