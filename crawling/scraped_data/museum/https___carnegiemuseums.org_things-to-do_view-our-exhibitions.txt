Where else can you see dinosaurs AND the art of Andy Warhol? Toss in a World War II submarine, original Monets and Degas, life-size casts of some of the world’s great architecture, and two of the largest displays of robots and the science of sports on the planet. And that’s just what makes us permanently interesting. Our museums also create and host dozens of special exhibitions each year.
