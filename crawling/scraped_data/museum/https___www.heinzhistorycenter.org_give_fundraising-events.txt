Fundraising Events
Celebrate the ‘can do’ spirit and rich history of the Pittsburgh region by attending an annual History Center fundraising event. From the museum’s yearly 21+ party, History Uncorked, to its black-tie gala, History Makers Award Dinner, the Smithsonian’s home in Pittsburgh is dedicated to bringing people together, preserving our shared history, and inspiring the leaders of tomorrow.
Annual fundraising events directly impact the museum’s award-winning exhibitions, public programs, educational outreach, and publications. Because of your support, our team preserves and cares for hundreds of thousands of historic artifacts and archival materials for future generations.
History Makers Award Dinner
The History Makers Award Dinner is a tradition that celebrates exceptional individuals with connections to Western Pennsylvania, whose accomplishments transcend geographic bounds.
