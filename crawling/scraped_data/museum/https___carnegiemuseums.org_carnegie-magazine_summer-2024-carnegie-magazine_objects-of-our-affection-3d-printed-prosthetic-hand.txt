Objects of Our Affection: ‘Golden Orioles’
In 2016, Carnegie Science Center’s BNY Mellon Fab Lab partnered with e-NABLING the Future, a global community of thousands of volunteers, to make 3D-printed prosthetic hands for people in need. After a few months of training in the Science Center’s maker space, about a dozen area high school students crafted the prosthetic hands. They then led a group of local volunteers in assembling the fully functional limbs, which were sent free of charge to children throughout the world who are missing all or part of their hands due to injuries from violent conflicts or disease.
