Pittsburgh Builds Bridges
How do you build bridges between people?
This question motivates artist Ebtehal Badawi every day. It led to the creation of Pittsburgh Builds Bridges, an initiative that encourages connection, inclusion, and compassion through community artmaking and conversation.
Ebtehal initially conceived her design as an anti-bullying campaign of posters in local schools after her son endured bullying as a young child. The concept grew, and Ebtehal has since brought together more than 5,000 Pittsburghers — children and adults, students, city officials, actors, artists, poets, dancers, and professional athletes, including the Pittsburgh Steelers, Pirates, and Penguins — to create murals at 50 locations across the region symbolizing unity and harmony. Ebtehal created this community mural with visitors at The Frick Pittsburgh's Summer Friday event on August 2, 2024.
Art has the power to draw people together, and Ebtehal's murals cultivate a sense of belonging. "I started this initiative to bring people together, to plant seeds of love, acceptance, and compassion."
Meet the Artist
Ebtehal Badawi is a Saudi-born artist, photographer, and writer living in Pittsburgh. She knew she wanted to be an artist in fifth grade. After starting her career in biology and industrial hygiene, she eventually transitioned to art, her first love. She is currently studying art therapy in addition to creating artwork.
An esteemed expressionist artist and dedicated culture explorer, Ebtehal embodies the transformative power of art. Her fervent belief in the power of art to heal and build bridges is a source of inspiration to many. Through Pittsburgh Builds Bridges, she has coordinated public art installations that unite the community and promote love and acceptance, one paint brushstroke at a time.
