Join the History Center and the Veterans Breakfast Club for a storytelling event honoring the strength and sacrifice of women during war time, from the battlefield to the home front.
Join the History Center and the Veterans Breakfast Club for a storytelling event honoring the strength and sacrifice of women during war time, from the battlefield to the home front.
Hear firsthand accounts from veterans and military families who will share their personal journeys of how military life has shaped their identities and their lives.
This program is not just about listening – it’s also about sharing. We encourage attendees to share their stories and unique perspectives on their life experiences.
The “Homefront and Frontlines: Women and the Impact of War” program is held in conjunction with the History Center’s new exhibition,
A Woman’s Place: How Women Shaped Pittsburgh
. The exhibit recognizes that military action and times of conflict have always been a double-edged sword for women, bringing sacrifice and loss but also opportunities for them to learn new skills, demonstrate untapped abilities, and enter previously inaccessible spaces closed to them during peacetime.
Whether soldier or civilian, military service has always required from women a complicated balancing act, managing the needs of home, family, work, and service, while supporting a loved one away on duty, or increasingly in the modern era, taking on that role themselves.
Admission
The program is free with advance registration. Please register in advance online.
