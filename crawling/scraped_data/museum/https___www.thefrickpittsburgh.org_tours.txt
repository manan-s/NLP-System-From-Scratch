.
"Our tour guide was excellent! Her knowledge and command of the history was excellent. It was clear that she has a love of her job. That's engaging. We had a youngster (about 10 - 12 years old) in our group. He was very bright and was not shy. Our guide did an excellent job of responding to him while not losing track of her objective. She integrated his quizzical mind into the interaction. It was actually amusing to the entire group. I really appreciate the efforts that the museum put into the development of the new tours." - William S.
