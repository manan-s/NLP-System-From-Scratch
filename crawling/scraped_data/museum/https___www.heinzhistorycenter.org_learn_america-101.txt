America 101
The Civic Season
Apps
As the largest history museum in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and a proud affiliate of the Smithsonian Institution, the Heinz History Center is committed to telling the American story and inspiring a community of citizens to explore what it means to be an American.
The History Center’s America 101 initiative empowers citizens to know and act on the promise of the country’s founders, enabling people today to write the next chapter of our democracy.
The museum engages visitors through public programs, special exhibitions, digital learning tools, and educational curriculum. It hosts the award-winning “Be the Change: 9th Grade Civics Summit” program, U.S. naturalization ceremonies, American flag folding events, and other forums to discuss issues such as civics, government, immigration, and history.
By 2026 – America’s 250th anniversary – America 101 will ensure that citizens in Western Pa. and beyond are more knowledgeable about American history and able to pass the history and civics portion of the U.S. citizenship test.
America 101 is supported by
Nimick Forbesway Foundation, Grable Foundation, Jack Buncher Foundation, Charity Randall Foundation,
and
UPMC.
The Citizen You App
The intuitive and easy-to-use Citizen You mobile app is designed to foster civic engagement by gamifying everyday civic actions. The FREE app helps bring together citizens of all ages to compete in challenges and earn points for a variety of civic-minded activities including attending local council meetings, helping a neighbor in need, and (most importantly) voting! Search “Citizen You” on the App Store or Google Play to download the app.

Virtual Tour: American Democracy: A Great Leap of Faith
The History Center examines the bold experiment to create a government “of the people, by the people, and for the people” in its dynamic online exhibition, American Democracy: A Great Leap of Faith. Developed in partnership with the Smithsonian’s National Museum of American History and the Smithsonian Institution Traveling Exhibition Service (SITES), the exhibit showcases the history of how we’ve voted, protested, and engaged with our politics, from the nation’s formation to today. The exhibit was on view at the History Center in 2021.
