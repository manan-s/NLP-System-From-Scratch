General
Membership Benefits
What museums are included in my membership?
Your membership includes the four Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh:
Carnegie Museum of Art
Carnegie Museum of Natural History
Carnegie Science Center
(including Highmark SportsWorks®)
The Andy Warhol Museum
What discounts do members receive?
Members receive a 10% discount in all four museum stores and cafes. In addition, members receive discounts on select classes, camps, and lectures (member pricing is listed when applicable).
What member events are offered?
Members enjoy exhibition previews, exclusive tours, lectures, and more! Please visit our
member events page
for a list of upcoming events.
Do members get reciprocal benefits at other museums?
Carnegie Science Center participates in the
Association of Science-Technology Centers (ASTC) Passport Program
which offers free or discounted admission to participating science centers and museums that are beyond a 90-mile radius of Pittsburgh and your home address.*
Just show your Carnegie Museums membership card and a photo ID for admission at ASTC institutions. We recommend calling before you visit, as the list of reciprocal museums may change without notice.
Premium level members and above also receive reciprocal admission to a list of select art and natural history museums. View the list here.
Using Your Benefits
When can I start using the membership?
Immediately!
Join online and you will receive a confirmation email to present at the museum for admission. Be sure to type your email address correctly and check, “Yes, I would like to receive communications.” (Still not seeing it? Check your promotions tab or junk folder.)
Buy it over the phone and we will send you a confirmation email at your request.
Join at the admissions desk and receive a temporary membership card to use right away.
Can I bring guests with my membership?
Individual:
Only the cardholder receives admission under the membership.
Dual:
Covers admission for two adults or one adult and one child. If only one cardholder is visiting, a guest child or adult may accompany him or her.
Family:
Covers admission for two adults and up to four children. At Carnegie Museums, we want all children to enjoy the museums, so feel free to bring your children’s friends, your nieces and nephews, or your neighbors.
Premium:
Covers admission for two adults and up to eight guests per visit. This is a great option for large families! One of the designated cardholders must be present to accompany guests.
Note: You can bring guests to member events just like you bring guests for a museum visit. If your membership does not allow for guests and you would like to bring more people, you can upgrade to a higher level by calling 412.622.3314.
Can my adult children or other relatives use my membership?
Our membership levels cover people, not households, so if you would like another family member to use your membership, please list them as one of the designated adults. Depending on your membership level, they may accompany you to the museum as a guest.
Memberships are not transferable: Adults not accompanied by a cardholder will not be admitted under the membership.
Can I use my membership for a group tour, field trip, or 21+ Night?
Free membership admission does not apply to group visits, field trips, or special programs such as 21+ Night due to additional programming and expenses related to these visits.
Can I visit without my membership card?
Designated adults on the membership can visit without their card. Simply show a valid photo ID at the admissions counter. Member children visiting without a designated adult or caregiver MUST have a membership card to gain admission under the membership.
How do I apply my member discount in the
online store
?
Use your 10% discount on unique and fun gifts from all four of our Carnegie Museums stores.
To receive your member discount on our online store, just enter code
CMPMember
in the Coupon box on the cart or checkout page and click Apply.

Digital Card FAQs
What is a “Carnegie Digital Membership Card”? Is it the same as an app?
Your optional Carnegie Digital Membership Card is an app that can be accessed on your smartphone.

The Carnegie Digital Membership Card is optional. If you don’t wish to download the card, simply disregard the message and you won’t be offered this feature until you renew your membership.
Will I still receive a physical Carnegie Membership Card?
Yes, you will still receive a physical Carnegie Membership Card whether or not you opt-in to the Carnegie Digital Membership Card.

Membership Levels
I have more than four children. Which membership level should I purchase?
Memberships cover a set number of people, not households. We have three levels intended for families of all sizes—Dual, Family, and Premium levels. The Premium is ideal for larger households. If more than two adults and four children (or one adult and five children) will be visiting the museum at once, consider purchasing our Premium membership.
What are your donor levels of membership?
Free admission is just the beginning—and your gift to the Carnegie Museums makes a difference! Visit our website to learn more about joining the
Donors Circle
or
Patrons Circle
or by calling our Donor Services line at 412.622.5772.

Will I receive renewal information before my membership expires?
Your expiration date is printed on your membership cards. We will send renewal notices starting at least two months before your membership expires to give you plenty of time to renew. Please let us know about any address or email changes, so that you receive renewal notices. Update your information by

I already renewed. Why am I still receiving notices?
