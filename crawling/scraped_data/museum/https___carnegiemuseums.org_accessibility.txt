Our museums welcome all visitors. We work to assist visitors with disabilities in obtaining reasonable and appropriate accommodations, and in supporting equal access to our websites, services, programs, and activities. Please note that requests for accommodations at our museums should be made at least two weeks prior to your visit. For specific questions about wheelchairs, strollers, or other programmatic or equipment needs, see Visitor Services at the museum information desk or email

, or call (412) 622-3131. The four Carnegie Museums are committed to keeping their websites compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act. We welcome any feedback on how to improve our sites’ accessibility for all users, and we strive to develop websites that are accessible to all.
