Escaping Requin
Carnegie Museum of Natural History contains one of the most comprehensive records of nature and culture in the world, caring for some 22 million specimens and objects that range from birds and botany to archaeological artifacts and dinosaur fossils. But few people know that it also boasts an impressive art collection. This watercolor painting, titled
Golden Orioles
, was made in 1909 by the English artist Winifred Austen for F.B. Kirkman’s
The
British Bird Book
. Born in 1876, Austen trained at the Central School of Arts and Crafts in London, was a member of the Royal Society of Painter-Etchers and Engravers, and exhibited her work frequently throughout her lifetime. And despite working in an overwhelmingly male-dominated profession, she made a place for herself and was the only woman to be published in the
British Bird Book
. Austen died in 1964.
