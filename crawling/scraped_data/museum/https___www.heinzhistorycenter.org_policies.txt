Privacy Policy
A COMMITMENT TO YOUR PRIVACY
Your privacy is very important to us. To better protect your privacy our policies below explain the information we collect, how it is used, how it is safeguarded, and how to contact us if you have any concerns.
WHAT INFORMATION IS COLLECTED:
Online Shop, Ticket Purchases, and Event Registrations
When you make a purchase from the History Center Museum Shop, buy tickets online, or register for our events, we require your name, billing and shipping addresses, telephone number, email address, and credit card information in order to process your order. Your credit card information will be used only as needed to process your transaction. We work to ensure that such transactions utilize SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encryption. SSL technology, an industry standard, is designed to prevent someone other than operators of our Site from capturing and viewing your Personal Information. Since any order information you provide to us on our Site will be transmitted using a secure connection, if your Web browser cannot support this level of security, you will not be able to order products through our Site. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet is 100% secure. While we strive to protect your information as much as possible, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of that information.
Online Memberships and Donations
When you purchase a History Center membership or make an online donation, we ask you to provide us with the information we need to process your membership and/or to acknowledge your contribution. This information includes your name, billing and shipping addresses, telephone number, email address and credit card information. Your credit card information will be used only as needed to process your transaction. We work to ensure that such transactions utilize SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encryption. SSL technology, an industry standard, is designed to prevent someone other than operators of our Site from capturing and viewing your Personal Information. Since any order information you provide to us on our Site will be transmitted using a secure connection, if your Web browser cannot support this level of security, you will not be able to order products through our Site. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet is 100% secure. While we strive to protect your information as much as possible, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of that information.
Online Surveys
From time to time, we may invite you to participate in surveys posted on our website or sent to you by email. You may decide whether or not you wish to complete such surveys, which may ask about your background, opinions or similar questions. We use this information to help us better understand our audience, which in turn allows us to better meet your needs and interests.

DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION
The History Center does not sell or rent any information to third parties. This applies to all donor information, including transactions both online and on-site. Periodically we do trade donor lists with other similar non-profit organizations that might be of interest to you. These trades may include your name, postal address, email address, and phone number.
