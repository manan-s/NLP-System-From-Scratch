If you have misplaced your membership card or have not received it by mail as of yet, please see our Museum Experience Associates in the Grable Visitor Center or The Frick Art Museum and they can verify your membership status.
Can I bring guests with me?
If you join at the Patron level ($250) you may bring up to two guests. Members at the Benefactor ($500) level and above may bring up to four guests.
Can another person use my membership if I am not present?

Is my membership transferable or refundable?
Our memberships are non-transferable and non-refundable. Benefits are subject to change.
Why does the Museum request my email address?
By providing your email address, you will receive our e-newsletter and have the ability to make online reservations for timed tickets and programs. If you have trouble logging in to your online profile, please call

Can I use my membership to visit other museums?
Members at the Fellow ($125) level and above receive reciprocal membership benefits to more than 1,000 museums through the North American Reciprocal Museum Association (NARM), the Reciprocal Organization of Associated Museums (ROAM) and the Art Museum Reciprocal Network (AMRN). Reciprocal benefits vary by organization. For more information and a listing of reciprocal institutions,

.
Are you the same museum as The Frick Collection in New York? If I am a member here, am I a member there?
Although both institutions are properties that were owned by the Frick family, The Frick Pittsburgh and The Frick Collection are two separate institutions and therefore have separate membership programs. However, if you become a member at the Fellow ($125) level or above, you can receive free admission to The Frick Collection through our
reciprocal museum programs
.
Can I give a membership as a gift?
Absolutely! You may purchase a gift of membership
here
by selecting Gift on a membership level of your choosing. Once you reach the billing page, please let us know in the Comments section if you would like the gift membership package mailed to you or to the recipient. You may also call the Membership Department at
412-342-4086
or purchase a gift membership onsite.
Can I make a contribution in honor or in memory of someone?
You may make an honorary or memorial donation
online
and include your loved one’s name and contact information in the comments section once you reach the billing page. For memorial gifts, we are pleased to notify the family of your gift if their contact information is provided. For more information, please
email
or call the Membership Department at
412-342-4086
.
How can I find out if my company matches the contributions that I make to the Frick?
Many companies will match charitable contributions made by employees and retirees, doubling or tripling the impact of your gift. Contact your employer’s Human Resources department to find out if it has a matching gift program. Complete and mail the matching gift form along with your contribution to:
The Frick Pittsburgh
Advancement & Engagement Office
7227 Reynolds Street
Pittsburgh, PA 15208
Does the Museum share my information with anyone else?
We will never share your email address. From time to time, the Frick does exchange our members' mailing addresses with other local cultural organizations. If you prefer this information not be shared, please
