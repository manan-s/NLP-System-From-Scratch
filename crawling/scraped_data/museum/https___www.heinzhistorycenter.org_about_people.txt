Dr. James Adovasio
Director of Archaeology
James M. Adovasio, Ph.D, D.Sc, achieved international acclaim with his archeological excavation of the Meadowcroft Rockshelter beginning in 1973. His work at the Meadowcroft site brought the first serious challenge to the existing paradigm that people had only been on the North American continent for 13,000 years. Evidence from the excavation at Meadowcroft has demonstrated a human presence at the site of at least 19,000 years. The Meadowcroft Rockshelter is known around the world as an important North American archaeological site and was designated a National Historic Landmark in 2005.
In addition to his work at Meadowcroft, Dr. Adovasio has excavated at locations around the world and he is recognized as a global authority on perishable materials such as ancient basketry and textiles. He is the author of multiple books including “The First Americans: In Pursuit of Archaeology’s Greatest Mystery” (Random House, 2002), “The Invisible Sex: Uncovering the True Roles of Women in Prehistory” (Harper Collins, 2007), and his latest, “Strangers in a New Land” (Firefly Books Ltd., 2016), which documents 35 of the earliest sites in North and South America. He received his B.A. in Anthropology from the University of Arizona, his Ph.D in Anthropology from the University of Utah, and completed a Post-Doctoral Research Fellowship at the Smithsonian Institution.
