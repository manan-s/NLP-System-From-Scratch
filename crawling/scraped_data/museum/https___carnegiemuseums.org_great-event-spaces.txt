Carnegie Museums in Oakland
Home of Carnegie Museums of Art and Natural History, consider making this historic building the site of your next special event. From gilded halls to contemporary corridors, including: Carnegie Music Hall and its resplendent Music Hall Foyer, arguably the grandest event space in the city; the iconic Hall of Architecture and Hall of Sculpture; Scaife Foyer, a contemporary space ideal for large cocktail receptions; the Foster Overlook to Carnegie’s world-famous dinosaurs; and the stately Founder’s Room, where Andrew Carnegie once greeted his museum visitors. Reserve an entire museum or arrange a private tour and reception for your guests.
Carnegie Science Center
From its scenic perch along Pittsburgh’s North Shore, the Science Center doesn’t just peruse the mysteries of the universe—it offers unmatched views of Pittsburgh’s famous skyline and rivers, with plenty of convenient parking, lively exhibits, and cool ideas for truly original events.
Pointview Hall offers a panoramic view ofPittsburgh iconic bridges, Point State Park, the three rivers, and Mount Washington.
The Andy Warhol Museum
Why not give your next function a truly hip feel? There’s no more intriguing or distinctive space in Pittsburgh—the definitive home of the art and Pop sensibility of native-son Andy Warhol. The museum’s bold, bright lobby holds 120 seated guests and 200 for cocktails. Invite your guests to mingle with celebrities on a custom tour; or rent the entire museum for an evening. You can also host business meetings, lectures, or symposiums in the museum’s state-of-the-art film and video theater.
Weddings at the Museums
Make your wedding day truly memorable by celebrating it at one of the distinctively special Carnegie Museums. Our events and catering teams will work with you to create just the right atmosphere in just the right space, large or small.
Note:
Carnegie Museums reserves the right to decline or cancel bookings for our Event Spaces because of concerns regarding property damage, safety risks, legal liability and/or reputational harm to Carnegie Museums.  Further, Carnegie Museums does not accept bookings for partisan political events or fundraisers, including voter education, registration and get-out-the-vote drives led by partisan groups.
