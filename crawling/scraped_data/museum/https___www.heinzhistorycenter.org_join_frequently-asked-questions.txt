.
Can I use my membership for a group tour, field trip, or 21+ nights?
Free membership admission does not apply to group visits, field trips, or special programs such as 21+ nights due to additional programming and expenses related to these visits.
Is my contact or financial information shared with other organizations or vendors?
Please refer to our
Privacy Statement
“Disclosure of Personal Information” section.
Is my History Center membership tax-deductible?
A portion of your membership is not tax-deductible because of the value of member benefits received. If you wish to receive full tax-deductibility for your gift or have further questions or concerns, please contact us at 412-454-6436 or
[email protected]
.
My membership is still active, why am I receiving renewal notices?
We mail renewal notices prior to your expiration date to provide ample notice of your membership expiration. You may renew your membership any time before your expiration date to maintain an active membership.
I just sent my membership renewal gift. Why did I receive a renewal notice?
Renewal reminders are printed and mailed in bulk to save on expenses. As a result, membership gifts and renewal reminders occasionally cross in the mail. A renewal packet will always be sent to you acknowledging your gift. If you ever have questions about your membership status please contact us at 412-454-6436 or
[email protected]
.
Is it safe to use my credit card to purchase a membership on your e-store?
Yes, the Senator John Heinz History Center uses security and encryption technology to process all e-store transactions. Your financial information is never stored unencrypted on our server.
How long does it take to receive my History Center membership packet?
Membership fulfillment usually takes 7-10 business days. If you do not receive your History Center membership packet within this timeframe, please let us know and we will be happy to assist you.
I do not want my History Center membership any longer. Can I get a refund?
The History Center is unable to offer refunds on memberships. If, however, a financial mistake has been made processing your membership please let us know and we will work to correct and refund our error.
Can I upgrade my History Center membership to a higher level?
You can always upgrade your membership to meet your needs. You can easily do so by paying the difference in price of the two memberships. For more information, please contact us at 412-454-6436 or
[email protected]
.
If I join in person at the History Center, can my admission fees be applied toward a membership?
Yes, the cost of your admissions transaction can be applied towards a new membership. Any customer service associate at our Admissions Desk or Museum Shop can assist you with this.
I received a call from a History Center Telefund operator. Was that phone call legitimate?
The History Center occasionally hires an outside company to make phone calls to our members. These callers will always identify themselves as a company calling on our behalf.
