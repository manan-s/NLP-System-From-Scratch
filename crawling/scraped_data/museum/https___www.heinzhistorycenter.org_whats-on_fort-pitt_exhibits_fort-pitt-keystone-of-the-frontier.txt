Fort Pitt: Keystone of the Frontier
Fort Pitt: Keystone of the Frontier
In the mid-18th century, the contest for control of the lands west of the Appalachian Mountains was far from decided. Among the relative newcomers to the region were Shawnee, Delaware, and Seneca Indians in search of autonomy in the Ohio Country, as well as military representatives from the two most powerful nations in the world: England and France.
The clash of these two great empires, which began in the backwoods of present day Western Pennsylvania, forever changed the course of world events, had powerful repercussions for American Indians, and ultimately inspired thirteen rebellious colonies to declare their independence from Great Britain.
Explore these momentous events and their impact on our region in the museum’s flagship exhibition,
Fort Pitt: Keystone of the Frontier
. The exhibit features two audio-visual presentations covering both the French & Indian War and the American Revolution, intricate dioramas of the earliest forts at the Point, and numerous artifacts, all of which paint a vivid picture of war, trade, adventure, and diplomacy on the 18th century frontier.
