About the Building
Designed by the architectural team of Schwartz/Silver and Associates (Boston) and Loysen + Kreuthmeier (Pittsburgh) the 3,000-square-foot Grable Visitor Center is located in the center of the Frick’s 10-acre campus. Façades composed of low-iron, high-transparency glass and Pennsylvania sandstone integrate the new building into the existing landscape. Inside, a wood ceiling suspended by glass walls provide views of the vast Frick grounds.  A porcelain tile floor laid in a  herringbone pattern suggests decorative elements at Clayton.
To enhance the Frick’s environmental sustainability, the construction adheres to LEED standards. The glass design of the Grable Visitor Center provides a  visual connection to the Frick’s park-like setting, and enhances the “green” character of the facility through the use of natural  daylight. An exterior sun louver system reduces heat-gain and energy consumption required  for cooling. Building materials were selected based on recycled and Low-VOC (Volatile Organic Compound) content and, where possible, were harvested and manufactured within 500 miles of Pittsburgh.
The Grable Visitor Center project was recognized with a Certificate of Merit for Architecture by AIA Pittsburgh, the local chapter of The American Institute of Architects, in the Design Pittsburgh 2015 juried competition.
