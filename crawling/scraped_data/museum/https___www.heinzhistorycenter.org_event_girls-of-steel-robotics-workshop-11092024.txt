Assemble, wire, and drive a robot with Girls of Steel!
Presented in partnership with Carnegie Mellon University’s Girls of Steel Robotics team, this workshop invites 4th through 6th grade students to take inspiration from the “real-life” Rosie the Riveters and explore STEM.
Participants will enjoy a guided tour of the
A Woman’s Place: How Women Shaped Pittsburgh
exhibition, which includes a competitive robot from the Girls of Steel Robotics team.
Following the tour, attendees will engage in a mentor-led workshop, where they will have the opportunity to assemble, wire, and drive a robot chassis. Learn about a robot’s structural components and watch your design drive away!
Admission
The Girls of Steel Robotics Workshop is $5 per participant currently enrolled as a fourth, fifth, or sixth grade student. Program admission includes one FREE adult admission to the History Center on Saturday, Nov. 9.
Space for this workshop is limited, so please register in advance to secure your spot!

About Girls of Steel
In 2010, the Field Robotics Center at Carnegie Mellon University started a program to help close the gender gap in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics). The program began with 24 girls from 12 different schools. Today, a robust pipeline of programs, mentors, and outreach activities encourages girls and underrepresented youth, starting as young as age size, to explore STEM before gender stereotypes about technological ability and interest set in. More than 175 students participate from schools across the Pittsburgh region.
