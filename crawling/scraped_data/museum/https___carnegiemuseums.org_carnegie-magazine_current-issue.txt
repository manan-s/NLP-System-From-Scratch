Big Picture
During the spring and fall migrations, Powdermill Nature Reserve offers free open houses for visitors to observe how researchers safely capture and band birds, and learn about the data they gather. Visitors can also explore the trails at Powdermill on guided bird walks to find and identify birds in their native habitats. These walks are friendly to birders of all ages and experience levels. Spare binoculars will be provided on a first-come, first-served basis.
