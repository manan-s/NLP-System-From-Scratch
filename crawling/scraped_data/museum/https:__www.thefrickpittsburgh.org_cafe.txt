Frequently Asked Questions
We’ve received a lot of inquiries about the current business model and future of the Café. We thank you for your continued support and hope to answer some of your questions below.
Why did you change the Café? Wasn’t it already perfect?
The atmosphere is magical, and we are committed to keeping it so. But certain aspects of the Café’s pre-COVID business model didn't serve all of our visitors as well as they should. The adjustments we've made address some specific challenges:
In the past, the Café served a small number of people very well, but the great majority of our visitors not at all. During our busiest months, from April to December, the Café was been fully booked at lunchtime days in advance. We routinely turned away two, three, and even four times as many people as we could seat. Without an opportunity for rest and refreshment, many visitors left the Frick before they could experience all we have to offer.
By expanding our open hours, we hope to increase the number of visitors we can serve. From quick-and-easy delights to special-occasion indulgences, we are aiming to meet the needs of as many of our visitors as possible.
