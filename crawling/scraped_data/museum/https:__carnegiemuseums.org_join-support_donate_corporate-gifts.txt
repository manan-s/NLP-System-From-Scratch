Educational Improvement Tax Credit (EITC) Program
If you are a Pennsylvania business, the Educational Improvement Tax Credit (EITC) program could be beneficial to you. By participating in the program, you would receive a substantial tax credit and impact the community through your support of Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh.
How does EITC impact our youth?
EITC gifts help our museums provide innovative, informal education programming in the arts and sciences to as many as 10,000 public school students through virtual and in-person programs such as:
The Art Connection at Carnegie Museum of Art
is Pittsburgh’s premiere art program for students in grades 5-9. Students learn drawing, printmaking, painting, sculpting, and mixed media—culminating with a student exhibition.
SciTech at Carnegie Science Center
is a special field trip that features the industry growth areas of Pittsburgh, ranging from biotech to robotics and advanced materials/processes. It connects middle and high school students with leading STEM innovators in a fun, dynamic atmosphere as they explore interactive exhibits from leading STEM companies and organizations.
Museum on the Move
at Carnegie Museum of Natural History connects children and youth to the museum’s programs and collections through partnerships with local hospitals, special needs classrooms, homeless shelters, and community-based organizations.
Youth Invasion at The Andy Warhol Museum
is an annual spring celebration planned by members of the museum’s Youth Arts Council—a year-long leadership program for high school students. The event features local young performers and a themed exhibition of works by teen artists.
How does the tax credit work?
The Educational Improvement Tax Credit (EITC) program, administered by Pennsylvania’s Department of Community and Economic Development (DCED), encourages strategic philanthropy by allowing companies to distribute their tax dollars to organizations like Carnegie Museums that support the important work of our schools through creative programming.
Thanks to the EITC program a one-year commitment to an education program at Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh can earn your company a tax credit of 75% of the contribution. The tax credit can be increased to 90% of the contribution if your company agrees to provide the same amount for two consecutive tax years.
Getting started is easy!
To start the application process, visit
CarnegieMuseums.org/EITC
for EITC guidelines and access to the PA DCED’s electronic single application system. Once you apply and are approved, make your contribution to Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh within 60 days.
To learn more about qualifying Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh educational programming and how EITC can work to your company’s advantage, contact a member of our team at
