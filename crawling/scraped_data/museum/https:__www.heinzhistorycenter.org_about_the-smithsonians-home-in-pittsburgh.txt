The Smithsonian’s Home in Pittsburgh
The Heinz History Center is proud to be the flagship Affiliate of the Smithsonian Institution.
Since 2000, this collaborative partnership with the world’s largest museum system has allowed the History Center to bring world-class Smithsonian exhibitions and artifacts to Western Pennsylvania.
Iconic Smithsonian artifacts, such as the world’s oldest jeep or one of the first commercial radio transmitters, are always on view at the Smithsonian’s only affiliate museum in Western Pennsylvania.
As a Smithsonian Affiliate, the History Center regularly hosts groundbreaking, award-winning exhibitions developed in partnership with the Smithsonian Institution Traveling Exhibition Service (SITES), such as
Destination Moon: The Apollo 11 Mission, Portraits of Pittsburgh, American Democracy
, and more.
In addition to exhibitions, the History Center and the Smithsonian work closely on a wide scope of projects, including public programs, educational workshops, professional development, and publications.

Model of the Rodman Process pioneered at the Fort Pitt Foundry, c. 1864 (base added in 1878)  
The first gun built using the Rodman hollow casting process was made at the Fort Pitt Foundry in the 1850s. In 1860, the War Department commissioned Rodman to build the world’s first 15-inch cannon. By 1864, Rodman had also supervised the fabrication of a massive 20-inch gun. This model depicts the specialized intricate casting apparatus used in making the first 20-inch Rodman, which required nearly 80 tons of molten iron poured from three furnaces. A complex four-piece mold was required to shape the cannon, which was cast in an upright position. The completed 20-inch gun barrel, one of six made at the Fort Pitt Foundry, weighed 117,000 pounds. This model educated West Point Military Academy cadets on the casting techniques pioneered in Pittsburgh.

KDKA transmitter, c. 1921 
In the days when there were few regulations for radios, Frank Conrad, a Westinghouse engineer, built a makeshift studio in his garage and played records over the airwaves. His supervisor at Westinghouse, Harry P. Davis saw Conrad’s hobby as a great way to sell more radios, and they applied for the first commercial radio license. On October 27, 1920, they received the call letters KDKA and set up a small studio in Westinghouse’s East Pittsburgh Works. On November 2, KDKA broadcast the election results between Harding and Cox, credited as the first commercial radio broadcast.

This replica transmitter retains some parts from Frank Conrad’s original, which is credited with the first commercial radio broadcast.
