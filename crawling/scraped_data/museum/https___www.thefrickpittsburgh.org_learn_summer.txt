Learning at the Frick
We believe that every visit is an opportunity to learn, to be inspired and to be delighted by art, history and nature, and we offer many different opportunities to learn in ways that mean the most to you.
Take a guided tour of Clayton or explore the current exhibition on your own, join us for a workshop or a lunchtime lecture, or simply walk the grounds and feel refreshed.
We welcome you to visit and discover all that you can learn at the Frick.
Looking to schedule a field trip? January and February offer more flexibility in available dates. Consider scheduling a program during this time to save $2 per student.

For Educators
Our hands-on learning programs for students K-12 are teacher friendly, address academic standards and use art, history, and nature to understand different times and contexts.  Frick programs address cross curricular standards, integrating writing, art, science and even economics to broaden student perspectives.
If you're interested in bringing your students to The Frick, our 2024-2025 School Programs Booklet is the best place to start the planning process. The booklet contains all of the information you need to plan an exciting, engaging field trip for your students, including program descriptions by grade level, lunch information, and tips for booking. By popular demand, we have also added an a la carte option that allows you to customize your own field trip experience! Download your free copy below.

Our programs explore the interdisciplinary nature of the Frick—from fine art in The Frick Art Museum, to life in the gilded age in Clayton, to the history of transportation in our Car and Carriage Museum.
