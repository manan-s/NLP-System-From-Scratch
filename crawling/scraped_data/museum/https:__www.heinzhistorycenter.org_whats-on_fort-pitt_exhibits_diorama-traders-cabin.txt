Diorama & Trader’s Cabin
Diorama & Trader's Cabin
Step back in time to the 18th-century frontier and discover what life was like for the earliest residents of the region throughout the Fort Pitt Museum’s interactive and family-friendly first floor gallery.
Survey our meticulous diorama for a glimpse of 18th-century Pittsburgh in miniature. Bring furs to market at the Trader’s Cabin and peer inside a replica Casemate to see munitions being made deep within the walls of Fort Pitt. Learn about the artillery that kept watch over the fort during the French & Indian War and see if you have what it takes to be part of the crew on our replica cannon. Then head to the Soldiers’ Barracks to discover what life was like for the troops that garrisoned and protected Pittsburgh.
