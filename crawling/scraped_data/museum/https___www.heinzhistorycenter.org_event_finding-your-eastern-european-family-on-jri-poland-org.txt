Use
JRI-Poland.org
to search for family, events and towns successfully!
Come learn to use the
JRI-Poland.org
database effectively to find data about your family. See it within the context of the town and Jewish community in which your family lived if they lived in the current or former territories of Poland. These include over 1900 towns represented on the JRI-Poland website for places once in Poland and possibly in Ukraine, Germany, Belarus, or Lithuania today. If your family said they were from “Russia” or “Galicia” or “Austria-Hungary” or “Prussia”, chances are that there is something in the JRI-Poland database waiting for you to discover!
This program is possible through the generous support of the William M. Lowenstein Genealogical Research Endowment Fund of the Jewish Community Foundation.
