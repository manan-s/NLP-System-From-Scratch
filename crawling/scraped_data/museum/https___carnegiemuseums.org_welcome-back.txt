What to expect when you visit
Your safety is our number one goal. We know that you expect a great experience when you visit any of the four Carnegie Museums and thoughtful measures have been taken to ensure that we meet your expectations.
Currently,
masks are optional for visitors to Carnegie Museums
. We will continue to monitor the pandemic and respond to expert guidance, and we stand ready to adjust our policy should that prove necessary. Please see the summer camp pages of each museum’s website for information regarding mask policies for summer camps.
Masks are available on-site if you request one. If you have tested positive for COVID-19, are experiencing symptoms, or have been exposed to COVID-19, we invite you to explore our virtual offerings at
Carnegie Museums From Home.
If you or a family member have not been vaccinated, please consider taking this important step to protect yourselves and others around you!
