From Slavery to Freedom
From Slavery to Freedom
Explore more than 250 years of African American history in the History Center’s exhibition,
From Slavery to Freedom
.
The long-term exhibit, presented by
BNY Mellon
, highlights the enslavement of Africans and its impact on the American economy, the history of the anti-slavery movement, the Underground Railroad, and the impact of 19th-century activism on the modern quest for civil and human rights in Pittsburgh.
Immerse yourself in the evolution of the region’s African American community, embarking on a journey that begins in 18th-century Africa, crosses the Atlantic Ocean on a recreated slave ship, toils in bondage on plantations of America, joins the Underground network of freedom seekers, fights for freedom in the Civil War, organizes for civil rights, and ends in 21st-century Western Pa.
Exhibit Must-Sees

Four life-like figures, including one of Medal of Honor winner Alexander Kelly of the 6th USCT and Martin Delany, a prominent Pittsburgh abolitionist and the highest ranking African American officer in the Union Army during the Civil War.
