Visitor Conduct Policy
Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh, which includes Carnegie Museum of Art, Carnegie Museum of Natural History, The Andy Warhol Museum and Carnegie Science Center (collectively, the “Museum”), celebrates free expression and strives to be an inclusive institution where diverse perspectives can coexist. However, for the safety and welfare of all, we ask that Museum visitors show common courtesy to fellow visitors and to Museum staff and service providers by not engaging in any physical, verbal, or written behavior that is unsafe, illegal, violence inciting, abusive, disorderly, disruptive, hostile or threatening to, or constitutes hate speech directed at, fellow visitors, museum staff, service providers, or others.
The Museum reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to deny admission to or to remove any persons engaging in such behavior, including persons wearing attire or having visible tattoos displaying language or designs that could pose a safety or security risk or create a hostile environment for visitors, staff, or service providers. Any visitor witnessing such behavior should report the activity immediately to Security or Museum Visitor Services staff. Any Museum staff witnessing or receiving a report about such behavior from a visitor should report the activity immediately to Visitor Services Management or Safety Management and contact Security as needed.
