A Great Day for Hockey!
A Great Day for Hockey!
It’s always “A Great Day for Hockey” inside the Western Pennsylvania Sports Museum!
Pittsburgh Penguins fans won’t want to miss the Sports Museum’s newest exhibition that showcases artifacts from all five Stanley Cup teams, in addition to game-worn equipment from legends like Mario Lemieux, Sidney Crosby, Evgeni Malkin, and Marc-Andre Fleury.
Along with documenting the Penguins’ franchise, A Great Day for Hockey tells the fascinating history of the sport of hockey in Pittsburgh, from Olympians like Drury, Brianne McLaughlin, and Paralympian Dan McCoy, to the region’s early teams like the Yellow Jackets and Hornets. The exhibit also features game-worn items from the Pittsburgh Pennies, who were a professional women’s hockey club that competed in the Mid-Atlantic Women’s Hockey League.
Fans can take on the cross-state rival Philadelphia Flyers in a game of bubble hockey, experience the sights and sounds of the Penguins’ championship wins, and take a selfie with a lifelike figure of Lemieux hoisting an exact replica of the Stanley Cup!

Artifact Spotlight: Mario Lemieux 1991 Stanley Cup Jersey
Mario Lemieux captained the Pittsburgh Penguins to their first Stanley Cup Championship in 1991, defeating the Minnesota North Stars, four games to two. Lemieux, who missed the first 50 games of the 1990-91 season due to back surgery, was a major force in the playoffs. In 15 games, he scored 16 goals and notched 18 assists to win the Conn Smythe Trophy for most valuable player of the playoffs.
Celebrate the athletes and sports fans in your life.
