Trails to Trains
The
Trails to Trains
exhibit at Meadowcroft Rockshelter and Historic Village transports visitors through time, exploring the evolution of transportation in Southwestern Pennsylvania using five vehicles from the collection.
Trailblaze 19,000 years of transportation history beginning with our prehistoric predecessors using foot power to navigate the rugged terrain surrounding the Meadowcroft Rockshelter, to the early days of the National Road, where Conestoga wagons dotted the landscape, to the use of the Stage coach to satisfy our need for speed, and finally to the development of the railroad as train rails cut through many rural Pennsylvania farmsteads.
