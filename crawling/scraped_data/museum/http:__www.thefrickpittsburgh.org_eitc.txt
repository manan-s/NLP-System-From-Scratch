Educational Improvement Tax Credit Program (EITC)
The Educational Improvement Tax Credit Program is a Pennsylvania tax credit for businesses who make a donation to an approved nonprofit organization.  The Frick Art Pittsburgh, a valuable source of innovative learning and inspiration, is an approved Educational Improvement Organization.
Companies making a contribution to the Frick through EITC can receive significant tax benefits.  Approved corporations can receive tax credits equal to 75 percent of its contribution up to a maximum of $750,000 per taxable year.  Businesses who agree to provide the same amount for two consecutive tax years can receive 90% of the contribution as a tax credit.  This can mean you receive up to 90% of your gift total as a tax credit: your $10,000 gift could result in a credit as high as $9,000.
Contact Manager of Insitutional Support Jodi Golomb for details at 412-342-4089 or

EITC in 3 Easy Steps
Step 1
Determine if you qualify.
Businesses or corporations can qualify if they pay any of the following taxes:
Bank and Trust Company Shares Tax
Corporate Net Income Tax
Capital Stock and Franchise Tax
Mutual Thrift Institutions Tax
Shareholder and Partner personal income tax (S Corps and Partnerships with pass-through tax liability)
Step 2
Apply.
Eligible businesses can apply to participate in the EITC program
here.
Step 3
Make the Frick the recipient of your EITC-eligible contribution
Once your application has been approved by the Department of Community and Economic Development (DCED), your business must contribute to a qualified organization, such as the Frick, within 60 days.  You need to send proof of the contribution to DCED within 90 days of the approval.  The Frick will send you an acknowledgement letter as proof of your contribution, and you are required to send a copy of this letter to DCED.
Your support impacts thousands of students
In addition to receiving tax benefits, your EITC gift supports impacts thousands of students by helping to underwrite various types of programs and visits by school groups throughout the region.  The Frick’s meaningful and standards-based education programs enhance the experiences of children and underserved students.  Using interactive activities and adaptive lessons, we engaged students in a meaningful way with our interdisciplinary collections.
