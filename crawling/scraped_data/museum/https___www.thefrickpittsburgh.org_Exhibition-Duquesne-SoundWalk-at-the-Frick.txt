Duquesne SoundWalk at the Frick
Duquesne SoundWalk at the Frick
is a new collaboration with students of Duquesne University’s Mary Pappert School of Music. The sounds of Frick past come to life through soundscapes, adding a new layer of dimensionality to the museum-going experience!
QR code exhibits, or SoundSites, are stationed throughout the Frick campus and allow visitors to interpret environment, culture, and history through sound. Recreations of the soundscapes surrounding Clayton in the 1890s, the home of a turn-of-the-century steelworker, the evolution of automobile horns, and the music enjoyed by the Frick family are just some of the sounds visitors can immerse themselves in throughout the site. Pick up a map in the Grable Visitor Center, or discover the stops as you wander the grounds. Use the camera on your smartphone to scan the codes and enjoy! If you don’t have a smart phone, stop by the Visitor Center to borrow one.
The SoundWalk project was recently awarded the 2023-24 John G. Rangos Sr. Prize, a university-wide prize given to innovative academic initiatives imagined by Duquesne University students and faculty members. SoundWalk led Dr. Nicole Vilkner, assistant professor of musicianship, and her students will continue to develop new SoundWalk projects in the future in new locations.
