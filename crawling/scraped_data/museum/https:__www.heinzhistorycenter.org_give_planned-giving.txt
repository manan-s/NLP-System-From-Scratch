By supporting the History Center through Planned Giving, your generous donation will allow future generations to enjoy the museum’s many offerings.
The History Center offers a variety of estate-planning instruments that provide benefits to both donors and the museum. Some options avoid or reduce capitals gains and estate taxes while others provide income for you or your designees.
The History Center staff is here to work with you and your advisors to help you achieve your charitable goals, which could include:
Outright gifts and gifts of appreciated securities
Life income gifts, including charitable remainder trusts
Charitable lead trusts
Gifts through your will, including a variety of bequest options
Gifts of real estate
Gifts of insurance

The History Center recently earned the coveted 4-star rating from Charity Navigator for sound fiscal management and commitment to accountability and transparency, so you can be confident that your donation is going to a great place.
