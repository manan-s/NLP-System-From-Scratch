Artifact Donations
The Heinz History Center actively seeks artifacts and archival materials related to the history of Western Pennsylvania and the experiences of its people, both past and present. If you have an object, photo, or other archival material that you think is of historic significance, we want to hear from you!
Donate an Artifact
Can your employer match your gift? You can double or triple your gift if you or your spouse work for an organization that matches charitable contributions to the History Center. Please contact your organization’s human resources department for their matching gift policy.
You can also make a donation by contacting Lauren Meals at 412-454-6351 or
