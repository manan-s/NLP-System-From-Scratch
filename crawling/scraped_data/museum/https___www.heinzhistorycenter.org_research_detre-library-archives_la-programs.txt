Programs for Students
The Detre Library & Archives also regularly engages students in discovery-based educational programs. These programs present the Detre Library & Archives as a hands-on history lab in which students critically analyze original primary source materials from our collection. These student research visits are integrated into a number of the History Center’s ongoing
educational programs
.
