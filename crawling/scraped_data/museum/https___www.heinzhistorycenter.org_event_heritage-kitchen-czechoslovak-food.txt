Join the History Center for a taste of Czechoslovakian food traditions and immerse yourself in our region’s culinary culture!
Presented in collaboration with the University of Pittsburgh’s Nationality Rooms and Intercultural Exchanges Programs (NRIEP), the History Center’s Heritage Kitchen series is a multi-generational cooking experience that explores the historical and cultural significance of recipes passed down through families and communities.
At the museum’s Heritage Kitchen: Czechoslovak program, the Czechoslovak Room Committee will prepare Chiebecky, a popular Slovak country dish.
Samples of the delicious dish will be available for noshing at the end of the demonstration.
Taste, learn, and connect with the vibrant flavors and rich histories that make these dishes more than just food—they are a testament to the enduring legacy of the diverse ethnic communities of Pittsburgh.
Admission
The program is $10 for non-members and FREE for History Center members. Admission to the program also includes full access to the Heinz History Center and Western Pennsylvania Sports Museum on Saturday, Nov. 16.
The event will be held in the museum’s third floor Weisbrod Kitchen Classroom. Doors open at 10:45 a.m.
Capacity is limited for this event. Please register in advance online to reserve your spot!

About the NRIEP
The University of Pittsburgh’s Nationality Rooms and Intercultural Exchanges Program’s (NRIEP) mission is sharing stories of regional ethnic communities past and present through inspirational spaces and intercultural experiences.
The Nationality and Heritage Rooms represent the University’s initial commitment to diversity when regional ethnic communities were invited to contribute to cultural representations of their heritages in the rooms. The Nationality and Heritage Rooms are designated as historic landmarks by the Pittsburgh History & Landmarks Foundation.
The NRIEP also represents the University’s ongoing engagement with the regional community through the Nationality and Heritage Room Committees. The committees provide financial support to Pitt students to undertake global learning experiences in the summer, and they organize intercultural programming on campus that engages Pitt students, faculty, and staff with members of the community across generations.
About The Czechoslovak Room
Donations for the Czechoslovak Nationality Room started to be received in 1925. A permanent Room Committee was formed in 1927. More donations came from local Pittsburgh events such as children’s choir concerts, benefit Symphony Orchestra performances, and soloist performances, along with donations from a committee formed in Czechoslovakia. The Czechoslovak room was dedicated March 7, 1939, on the 89th anniversary of the birth of Thomas Garrigue Masaryk, President of Czechoslovakia.
