Carnegie Museum of Art
Sunday, November 10, 2024
6:00 p.m. – 9:00 p.m.
You’re invited to a special member viewing of the
NEW Charles “Teenie” Harris Archive Gallery and exhibition
Tatiana Bilbao Estudio: City of Rooms
at Carnegie Museum of Art.
In 2001, following Harris’s wishes, Carnegie Museum of Art purchased his archive of more than 70,000 black-and-white and color negatives, prints, and films from the artist’s family. This new gallery is the most expansive expression of the archive to date offering unparalleled access to the breadth of Harris’s body of work, featuring never-before-seen color photographs and moving images alongside iconic black-and-white photographs, film negatives, and recorded oral histories.
Where do we find rest? How do we share our meals? Can the spaces we inhabit daily help us better nurture one another? In
Tatiana Bilbao Estudio: City of Rooms
, five galleries are assigned an individual room typology—kitchen, bedroom, bathroom, living room, and garden. The architects associate each room type with current projects, revealing, for instance, the role of communal kitchens in a residential building in Mexico City or the way small gardens coexist with houses in St. Louis, MO. These relationships offer new possibilities for privacy and publicness.
Join us for an exclusive look at the new gallery and exhibition and an opportunity to socialize with fellow members over light bites and refreshments.
