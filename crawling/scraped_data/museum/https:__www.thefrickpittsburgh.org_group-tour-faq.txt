Frequently Asked Questions
When should I make my reservation?
We require reservations be made at least six weeks in advance for most group reservations.
Where may we park our bus?
Free bus parking is available on Reynolds Street adjacent to our site.
Buses may not enter or park in our lot due to space limitations.
How much time should groups allow for touring?
Docent-led tours of Clayton are about an hour in length, and exhibition tours take 45 minutes.
We recommend that groups allow 2.5 to 3 hours when visiting so that participants may also have ample time to visit, at their leisure, The Frick Art Museum, Car and Carriage Museum, Greenhouse, and the Frick Museum Store located in the Grable Visitor Center. Some participants may also wish to stroll the grounds.
How will my group tour be organized?
Large groups are broken up into smaller sub-groups of 8 to 10 people.
What lunch accommodations are available?
We are able to accommodate groups of 12 or fewer at The Café at the Frick, depending on availability.
We also offer rental of lunch facilities if you wish to source lunch elsewhere. When you book your tour, please ask about our list of recommended restaurants and caterers near the Frick.
We recommend that group leaders call restaurants in advance of your tour day to ensure that groups can be accommodated.
What shopping options are available?
The Frick Museum Store, located in the Grable Visitor Center, features a wide array of Frick-related merchandise.
In addition, Pittsburgh’s Shadyside neighborhood, just moments away, offers a number of specialty shops and boutiques.
What can we expect when navigating the Frick site?
The Frick is loacted on a 10-acre site. There is a relatively level five-minute walk on the path between Clayton and The Frick Art Museum. For additional information on accessibilty please click
