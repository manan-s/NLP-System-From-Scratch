Individually, Carnegie Museum’s collections are impressive. Together, they’re unparalleled in scope and diversity. Our museums are home to some of the most historically significant and artistically brilliant collections in the world—the foundation of the museums’ expansive research, exhibitions, and educational offerings.
Carnegie Museum of Art
With a collection of more than 30,000 works, areas of excellence include Old Master prints and drawings, nearly 3,000 Japanese prints, Impressionism, the expansive Teenie Harris Archive, our film and video archive, and contemporary art from the 1980s to the present, along with iconic works from other eras.
Carnegie Museum of Natural History
A wondrous collection of millions of objects and scientific specimens used every day to broaden our understanding of the history of Earth, evolution, conservation, and biodiversity.
The Andy Warhol Museum
It’s the definitive collection of all things Warhol, including the artist’s 610 Time Capsules and 12,000 paintings, drawings, prints, photographs, sculpture, films, and videos. Archives include more than 500,000 objects.
