Expedition Patagonia – Livestream
Carnegie Museum of Natural History’s Vertebrate Paleontology team is headed to Patagonia for a three-week, dinosaur-filled adventure! We’re hoping to share this experience with everyone back home through a series of livestream events. Join us both in the field and from the lab to learn more about some incredible Southern Hemisphere dinosaurs and what it’s like to be a paleontologist.
All these events are free and open to all! Please share with family, friends, colleagues, and fellow dinosaur-enthusiasts. No prior registration is necessary.
All events can be accessed through this link:
https://vimeo.com/event/2872227
Fieldwork can be unpredictable! We will be working in remote international locations, and may need to delay, reschedule, or cancel these events due to technical difficulties, weather, or other variables. If we make the tough decision to cancel the live event, we will share a recording of the presentation as soon as we can. If we are unable to begin the livestream by 4:15 EST, the event will be rescheduled to its posted “rain date”.

Expedition Patagonia: In the Field with Titanosaurs
Thursday, February 23, 4 p.m. (EST)
Rain date
– Friday, February 24, 4 p.m. (EST)
Join Carnegie Museum of Natural History’s Vertebrate Paleontology team at the Estancia Laguna Palacios field site, where excavations of a titanosaur fossil are underway. Get a taste of what it’s like to work out in the field as you learn more about the largest animals to have ever walked the Earth.
Expedition Patagonia: In the Lab with Megaraptors
Tuesday, February 28, 4 p.m. (EST)
Rain date
– Wednesday, March 1, 4 p.m. (EST)
The Vertebrate Paleontology team is headed indoors to conduct exciting research with local Argentinian scientists. Hear about the journey fossils take from the desert to the lab, how they are properly cared for and preserved, and what fossils can tell scientists about a dinosaur species straight out of Jurassic Park – megaraptors.
Expedition Patagonia: In the Field with Patagonia’s Last Dinosaurs
Saturday, March 4, 4 p.m. (EST)
Rain date
– Sunday, March 5, 4 p.m. (EST)
Journey back out into the field with us to the beautiful headwaters of the Rio Chico. There, you’ll get a front-row seat to a newly discovered site where scientists are actively working to identify the dinosaur species. Our paleontologists will explain how they know where to dig in the vast Patagonian wilderness and share stories about some of the last dinosaurs to have lived in the area millions of years ago.
