The Frick Pittsburgh Equity Commitment
Diversity, Equity, Accessibility, & Inclusion
The Frick Pittsburgh is committed to better serving our community—visitors, staff, artists, scholars, educational partners, and neighbors. The Frick will be an anti-racist, welcoming multicultural organization, a place where all can have authentic experiences with art, history, and nature.
The Frick will work to create an inclusive, equitable, and enlivened creative space by:
Featuring a diverse representation of art, artifacts, and artists in our galleries with specific focus on those historically marginalized by museums;
Broadening the scope of historical narratives presented by inviting new voices and engaging multiple perspectives;
Interpreting inclusive historical narratives relevant in the context of the Frick legacy, Pittsburgh, and the Industrial Age with critical reflection, honesty, and transparency;
Engaging artists, performers, scholars, and community partners diverse in age, race, ethnicity, ability, gender, and sexuality in educational and public programming that explores an array of cultural experiences and intellectual inquiries;
Addressing the physical, mental, and emotional needs of our audiences, employees, and neighbors;
Ensuring equal opportunity in employment and advancement and equity in compensation and professional development;
Engaging our staff and board in regular anti-racism education and self-reflection;
Advocating for change by addressing the expression of concerns related to discrimination, representation, accessibility, and equity.

View our Strategic Plan
The Frick Pittsburgh occupies ancestral lands of the Haudenosaunee, Lenape, Osage, and Shawnee peoples. As a place of history and nature, the Frick recognizes the cultural importance of land and the role of cultural institutions in the formation of collective memory. Displacement and erasure are not just histories for native peoples. Land acknowledgements, like historic sites themselves, are exercises in preservation and reconciliation, engaged with past, present, and future.
