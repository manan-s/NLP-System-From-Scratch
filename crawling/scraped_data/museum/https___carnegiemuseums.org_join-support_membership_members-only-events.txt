Looking Closely: Lessons from Carnegie Museums’ “Natural History Art” Collection
In 1973, the “M. Graham Netting Animal Portraiture Collection” was established through a grant by the Scaife Family Charitable Trusts.

Deirdre M.

A Very Andy Show and Tell
Next month, we will be celebrating our very own Andy Warhol Museum’s 30th anniversary. Did you know there is another museum dedicated solely to the artist over 4,500 miles away in Slovakia? Andy Warhol Museum of Modern Art in Medzilaborce (MMUAW) opened in 1991, making it the first museum in the world to be dedicated entirely to the Pop artist. MMUAW focuses its galleries on the life and work of Warhol as well as other contemporary artists who personally knew him such as Keith Haring and Jean-Michell Basquiat. Amongst authentic artifacts like Andy’s snakeskin jacket, prayer book, and cassette player, the museum’s most valuable piece is the Warhol brothers’ authentic baptismal gown, which Andy and both of his brothers wore during their baptisms.
In 2016, The Andy Warhol Museum of Modern Art celebrated its 25th anniversary and Donald Warhola, Andy Warhol’s nephew, visited the museum with his family on this special occassion. Click to hear about Donald’s experience at MMUAW along with his personal stories about Uncle Andy — all in celebration of The Andy Warhol Museum’s 30th anniversary this May!

Zoom In: Portraits in the Collection
Portraits date back at least 5,000 years ago to ancient Egypt, where a painting or sculpture was the only way to record the appearance of a person. Since then, painting, sculpture, and photography have created a world where a human face can be represented in nearly any medium—from a block of wood to a monochrome photograph. Be it clay, metal, oil, a disposable camera, or the phone in your hand—the subject stays the same.

Mars Mythology
He is the God of war, Guardian of agriculture, Spring, fertility, virility, and bounteous nature. He is Mars. Mars—or as the Ancient Greeks originally called him, Ares—begins as the god of bloodshed, not widely admired (unsurprisingly) by his fellow Olympians or us Earthly mortals. However, once Rome comes about, Ares gets a rebrand to become Mars, the emblem of Rome’s military dominance and a symbol of its overall prosperity and success. Not all that dissimilar from how Mars the planet has transitioned from being the (imagined) home to hostile alien invaders to humankind’s (possible) new benefactor.
Join us for this exclusive and illuminating journey through mythology and history as we explore the many stories of Mars with Dr. Andrew Korzeniewski!

Zoom In: Tea with King Tutankhamun at the Winter Palace Hotel
Many know parts of the story of the 1922 discovery of King Tutankhamun’s tomb in Egypt’s the Valley of the Kings.

The Irish Revolution in Pittsburgh
One hundred years ago, Ireland’s War of Independence helped end seven centuries of British rule. It also resulted in partition of the island and a civil war. About 14,000 Irish immigrants lived in Pittsburgh at the time, with tens of thousands more first-generation Irish Americans in the city and surrounding region. Journalist Mark Holan will explore their reactions to what was happening in their homeland, including the visits of Irish leaders to Pittsburgh.
Pittsburgh native Mark Holan has researched and written about Irish history and contemporary events for over a decade. His work has appeared in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette and Pittsburgh Quarterly magazine, in addition to other U.S. and Irish publications and websites, including his blog, markholan.org. Mark has presented original research at the American Conference of Irish Studies, the American Journalism Historians Association, and the Newspaper and Periodical History Forum of Ireland.
