Baseball in Pittsburgh
The best time to visit Pittsburgh is during baseball season, and an evening in Pittsburgh is best spent at one of the most popular ballparks in all of baseball,
PNC Park
. With downtown Pittsburgh serving as a scenic backdrop and a dramatic entry via the Roberto Clemente Bridge along the Allegheny River, you'll see why Pittsburghers and visitors love to
cheer for the Pittsburgh Pirates
. ABC News, TripAdvisor, ESPN and more have named PNC Park as an ultimate site to catch a game with a spectacular view of the Downtown skyline.
And there is always great events,
promotions and giveaways
during baseball season. Don't miss your chance to win t-shirts, hats, backpacks and bobble heads. You can have a front-row seat as you see the skyline light up on Fireworks Night, bring your dog to the ballpark on Pup Night every Tuesday, or stay after the game for a free concert on specific evenings.
While you are in town for a game, stop by the
Western Pennsylvania Sports Museum
or the
Clemente Museum
and relive some of the great moments of Pittsburgh sports history.
So round up your family and friends and make your way down to PNC Park to catch a game. Let’s Go Bucs!
