Jazz Musicians from Pittsburgh
It's known among jazz aficionados that Pittsburgh has an extraordinary jazz scene.
You can't find the breadth and quality of
jazz happening
in Pittsburgh in any city this size, anywhere.
The legacy is real.
Back in the day, jazz greats all passed through the 'Burgh on their way between New York and Chicago. Kids grew up in the 30s, 40s and 50s seeing their heroes in the flesh practically every night of the week. And they learned from them, they watched and listened and picked up those great vibes and sounds and moves that you still see and hear today in Pittsburgh's jazz joints, its theaters, clubs and pubs, including CJs in the Strip District and Manchester Craftsmen's Guild's MCG Jazz Series on the North Side. Also, don't miss, the annual
Pittsburgh JazzLive International Festival
every June in downtown Pittsburgh.
The legends are many; the talent could fill any Jazz Hall of Fame. Some are no longer with us but left an indelible imprint on Pittsburgh's jazz sound.
In jazz heaven this band of Pittsburgh greats entertains the saints:

Ray Brown, Paul Chambers
Drums:
Art Blakey, Kenny Clark

And the baton has been passed to today's performers who carry on the tradition. Many of today's performers have jazz genes passed from father to son and daughter, brother to sister, brother to brother, uncle to nephew, grandfather to grandson. That's how jazz is in Pittsburgh, family, a way of life.
