A Global Arts Perspective
Pittsburgh’s art scene is anything but ordinary
Contemporary museums large and small challenge the viewer from the instant they walk in, exploring modern issues, tackling societal ills and expanding minds in the process. See how these five arts-forward organizations are shaking things up in 2024 and beyond.
Mattress Factory
Mattress Factory
stimulates wonder and curiosity with its slate of artists this year including
Shohei Katayama
and
Asim Waqif
, whose individual works often examine ecology and the human impact while blending found and created pieces, and
Andrea Peña
, who accesses her work as a designer and choreographer to create performative, digital and sculptural works.

continues to honor contemporary art, too.
Reckoning: Grief and Light
from artist Vanessa German and
Pittsburgh and the Great Migration: Black Mobility and the Automobile
focus on the Black experience in America, while

Latin American Cultural Center
The
Latin American Cultural Center
, which opened in 2022, is a hub of
collaboration and education
located in the heart of the Oakland neighborhood. Permanent exhibits, including the stunning
Presencia de América Latina
mural and
Latin America and the Caribbean
objects and photography, exemplify the incredible vitality and diversity of this vast region of the globe. Through April 2024, be sure to visit their Mexican Masks: Symbols, Celebrations, Satire & Safety exhibit provides a robust history of masks throughout Mexican history and examples of modern uses of masks from professional wrestling to the Covid-19 pandemic.
Contemporary Craft
A working craft studio and modern, exploratory exhibition space are juxtaposed at this Only in Pittsburgh art venue. Just one highlight of an exciting 2024 exhibit schedule for
Contemporary Craft
is
Oneness
, with New Mexico-based artist Brie Ruais exploring embodiment with movement-based artworks representing interconnectedness and our intervention on nature.

Pittsburgh Glass Center
’s
Myth-Science of the Gatekeepers
