Pittsburgh Steelers Hall of Famers
A look at the City of Champions' recent honors with Hall of Fame enshrinements and retired numbers.
When you play and win for the Steelers, you are celebrated for life. We're taking a look at some of the recent inductees into the Pro Football Hall of Fame, who is on the horizon with Hall of Fame ambitions and the full list of Steelers Hall of Famers below.
You can celebrate these Pro Football Hall of Famers and other Pittsburgh greats in the City of Champions
all year long
.
The Steelers recently opened their own
Hall of Honor
to recognize all the great contributors to this historic franchise. From the Immaculate Reception monument and photo ops with The Chief outside
Acrisure Stadium
to a visit to the
Western PA Sports Museum at the Heinz History Center
, there is no shortage of ways to experience Steelers history in Pittsburgh.
Pittsburgh Steelers Pro Football Hall of Fame Inductees
2021 Class:
Five members of the Pittsburgh Steelers were enshrined at the
Pro Football Hall of Fame
in 2021. Pittsburgh legends Bill Cowher, Donnie Shell and Troy Polamalu were honored with the Centennial Class of 2020. Alan Faneca and Bill Nunn were honored with the 2021 class. The celebrations took place at the Tom Benson Hall of Fame Stadium in Canton, Ohio.
Alan Faneca
joined the Pittsburgh Steelers in 1998 and enjoyed a 206-game career in the three rivers city. Faneca started 14 playoff games, including four AFC championship games and a Steelers victory in Super Bowl XL. One of the best offensive linemen in franchise history, Faneca was a six-time, first-team All-Pro during his years with the Steelers; he was voted to nine Pro Bowls overall.
Legendary journalist and Steelers scout
Bill Nunn
was recognized with a video tribute as the first Black Contributor in the 100-year history of the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Nunn served 18 years as Pittsburgh’s assistant personnel director, then 23 years as a semiretired scout. Nunn also was inducted into the
Black College Hall of Fame
in 2010.
2020 Class:
Pittsburgh native
Bill Cowher
was the head coach for the Pittsburgh Steelers for 15 seasons from 1992 to 2006. In 2005, the Pittsburgh Steelers became the first team ever to win nine road games and the first sixth-seeded team in NFL history to win a Super Bowl, defeating the Seattle Seahawks, 21-10, in Super Bowl XL.
Donnie Shell
joined the Pittsburgh Steelers in 1974 as a free agent. Shell capped his career with 51 interceptions, becoming the first strong safety in the history of the National Football League to surpass the 50-interception mark. His 51 career interceptions rank him third in Steelers history behind Hall of Famer Mel Blount (57) and Jack Butler (52).
Troy Polamalu
spent his entire 12-year professional football career with the Pittsburgh Steelers. Polamalu was a defensive leader who guided the Steelers to seven playoff appearances, five division titles and helped them win two of their three most-recent Super Bowl appearances – XL and XLIII.

Names To Watch for the Future
Ben Roethlisberger:
Kind of obvious, right? He was the Steelers starting QB, and the face of a historic franchise, for 18 years. He’s threw for over 63,000 yards and 417 touchdowns. His overall record is 165-81-1 and he’s been in six Pro Bowls. Steelers fans’ favorite Ben stat? He won two Super Bowls. He will be eligible for the HOF in 2027 and has a shot at getting in on his first try.
Maurkice Pouncey:
Big Ben’s right-hand man, Center Maurkice Pouncey made the 2010s All-Decade Team. He is a 9x Pro Bowler and five-time All-Pro selection. He'll be eligible for the HOF starting in 2026.
Art Rooney Jr. and Buddy Parker:
Both were finalists in the 2023 class. Rooney Jr. has been with the Steelers from 1965 to this day. He was the Steelers Personnel Director until 1985 and played a pivotal rule in crafting the Steelers 70s Super Bowl winning teams. Parker coached the Steelers, Detroit Lions, and Chicago Cardinals from 1949-1964. His career record was 104-75-9.
Hines Ward:
Hines has been knocking on the door for a few years now. Although he doesn’t have many individual accolades, he does have a huge list of intangibles as well as two Super Bowl rings and a Super Bowl MVP to his name.
James Harrison:
The fan-favorite OLB was the 2008 NFL Defensive Player of the year. He is also a five-time Pro Bowler, four-time All-Pro, and of course, has two Super Bowl Rings.
Mike Tomlin:
Tomlin has built up a coaching resume that is as impressive as his predecessors Bill Cowher and Chuck Noll. Going into the 2024 season, he is now the longest tenured head coach in the NFL, and amazingly still doesn’t have a losing season. He is a Super Bowl champion and has a great overall record of 173-100-2. Although he is probably far from retirement, he already has a Hall of Fame coaching resume at the age of 52.
T.J. Watt:
Watt is only 29, but you can't deny these stats: six-time Pro Bowler, three-time league leader in sacks and two-time league leader in tackles for loss and the Defensive Player of the Year in 2021. A few more seasons of this pedigree and Canton is going to be adding some more black and gold very soon.
