Autumn in Pittsburgh
Autumn in Pittsburgh
There are plenty of ways to enjoy Pittsburgh in the fall, no matter your interests, taste buds or even the weather.
There just aren’t words to describe the beauty of fall in Pittsburgh. The season begins with
summer
temperatures cooling down, then the
picturesque fall foliage
slowly spreads throughout the rolling hills that make up the city’s landscape.
What to Do
Take a ride on the
Duquesne Incline
for breathtaking panoramic views of the city. Hop on a bike and ride the 24+ miles of riverfront trails and beyond – the
Great Allegheny Passage
is a must in the fall for biking enthusiasts. Or, book a walking tour with
‘Burgh, Bits & Bites Food Tour
or
Walk the Burgh Tours
to discover more reasons why Pittsburgh is so special.
Plan a visit before Halloween and explore the spookier side of Pittsburgh with haunted attractions like
ScareHouse
, Zombies of the Corn and Hundred Acres Manor. Families can partake in the Halloween fun, too, with
ZooBoo at Pittsburgh Zoo & Aquarium
.
Fall also is a fantastic time of year for sports fans. Join Steelers Nation at Acrisure Stadium for a one-of-a-kind experience cheering on the
Pittsburgh Steelers
. From fall festivals to food festivals,
Three Rivers Beer Week
, world-class theater experiences and more, visitors are sure to find an entertainment option that fits their interest.
Two Hours in Pittsburgh
Even if you are short on time during your stay in Pittsburgh, there are a few things worth checking off the list.
There is always something to do or see in Pittsburgh’s
Schenley Park
, located in the Oakland neighborhood, near the University of Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon University. Stroll through the trails, watch the leaves change or even play a few holes of golf on the Bob O’Connor Golf Course if the weather allows.
Check out the
Lawrenceville
neighborhood’s Butler Street for some local shopping! The street is lined with trendy boutiques, vintage finds, beauty products and more. Plus, you’ll find plenty of options for a bite or a drink if all that shopping revs up your appetite.
Stop by the
Wigle Whiskey
Barrelhouse or Distillery, both of which offer guided tours for the public. Sample a variety of locally-distilled spirits and learn about the fascinating role Pittsburgh played in the Whiskey Rebellion. If you’re driving, skip the samples and pick up a bottle to take home!
