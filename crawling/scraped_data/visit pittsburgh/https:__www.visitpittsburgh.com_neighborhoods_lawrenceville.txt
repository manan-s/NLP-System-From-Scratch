Lawrenceville
Lawrenceville
​It's the city's biggest and arguably hippest neighborhood.
Home to many artists and designers, this trendy 'ville hosts some of the city's biggest arts events. It's a neighborhood on the rise with affordable properties, first-rate, one-of-a-kind shops and an awesome dining scene. The neighborhood has undergone such a revival that it's called a "go-to" destination by The New York Times. Located less than three miles from Downtown, it's a neighborhood with deep roots too. In fact, composer Stephen Foster's father charted the street plans in 1814.
The Vibe
Walkable and welcoming. Entrepreneurial. Unique and distinct. Old-world charm, modern-day edge.
The List
Go on an Allegheny Cemetery tour with the Office of Public Art
Take a spin at Arsenal Bowl, where cool meets retro
See and be seen at Art All Night
Visit
the Great One's legacy at The Clemente Museum
Shop and eat at the Annual Joy of Cookies Cookie Tour
The Name
Named for Captain James Lawrence, hero of War of 1812 and famous for his dying words, "Don't Give Up The Ship!"
One More Thing
Stephen Foster was born here. Every July, this composer of America's first pop songs like "Oh, Susanna" and "Camptown Races," is honored at "Doo Dah Days," a music festival held at the historic Allegheny Cemetery, where Foster is buried alongside other Pittsburgh celebrities.
