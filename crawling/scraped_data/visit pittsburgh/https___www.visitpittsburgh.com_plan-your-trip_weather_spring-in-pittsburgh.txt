Spring in Pittsburgh
Spring in Pittsburgh
There are plenty of ways to enjoy Pittsburgh in the spring, no matter your interests, taste buds or even the weather.
Spring in Pittsburgh aligns with the old saying, "in like a lion and out like a lamb." The season opens with winter weather. Then, spring showers roll in, and the city is in full, beautiful bloom.
What to Do
On the cool or rainy days, explore the city’s many indoor attractions. Plan a visit to
The Andy Warhol Museum
and experience the largest single artist museum in North America. Visit two museums in one and spend an entire day - and then some! - at the
Carnegie Museums of Art
and
Natural History
. Enjoy paintings, sculptures and architecture in the first and then dinosaurs, gems and jewels in the second. With hands-on activities for kids, it’s a fantastic experience for the whole family.
When the weather starts to break, be sure to get outdoors. From magnificent cherry blossoms on the North Shore to wildflowers atop Mount Washington, you’ll find beautiful spring colors blossoming throughout the entire city. For even more floral fun, plan a visit to
Phipps Conservatory and Botanical Gardens
– a lush oasis in the middle of Pittsburgh’s Oakland neighborhood.
And, of course, make plans to catch a
Pittsburgh Pirates
game at PNC Park – consistently named one of the best ballparks in America.
Two Hours in Pittsburgh
Whether you’re in town for a college graduation with a few hours to spare, or just passing through, there are a few must-see things in Pittsburgh that can be experienced in only a few hours.
For the garden-lover,
Phipps Conservatory and Botanical Gardens
is a beautiful place to explore seasonal flower shows in a gorgeous 14-room greenhouse. Plus, it’s minutes away from the campuses of University of Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon University.
Stroll through Downtown in the Cultural District. Check out the
public art
at Katz Plaza and the Magnolias for Pittsburgh as you walk down Penn Avenue. You can grab a drink or a bite at one of the many restaurants that line the avenue.
