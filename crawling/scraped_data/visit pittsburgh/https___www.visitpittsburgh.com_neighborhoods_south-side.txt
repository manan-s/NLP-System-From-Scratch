South Side
South Side
​South Side has variety galore.
Its "Great American Main Street" – East Carson Street, features 15 blocks of Victorian architecture and was named a National Historic District. Boutiques, restaurants, art galleries, theater and live music venues, are all within walking distance. You can also get a tattoo, dye your hair purple and hoist a yard, making for some of the best people-watching around!
The Vibe
Funky and feisty. Ethnic and historical. Colorful. Full of character (and characters).
The List
See the next Billy Porter at City Theatre
Hike or bike along its five miles of riverfront trail, or head to DC via the Great Allegheny Passage
Shop and dine at the SouthSide Works
Indulge in the annual Soup Contest
Check out The Workers, a steel sculpture dedicated to steelworkers
The Name
Located along the Monongahela River to the south of Downtown, the South Side is officially divided into two neighborhoods – the South Side Flats and the South Side Slopes.
One More Thing
The South Side Slopes has 68 sets of public stairs with a total count of 5,447 steps. Each October, the annual StepTrek takes "trekkers" to impressive city views.
