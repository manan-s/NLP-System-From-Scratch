Pittsburgh Glass Center is a nonprofit, public-access education center; an art gallery; a state-of-the-art glass studio; a community builder; and a hub for innovation and creativity.
Anyone can take classes, explore the gallery, and watch glass demonstrations. World-renowned glass artists come to create and teach. You can too!
We cultivate an inclusive and welcoming environment that encourages everyone, from the casually curious to the master artist, to learn, create, and be inspired by glass. We share our passion for glass locally and globally to advance a more diverse, vibrant, and accessible glass art community.
