Pittsburgh Pampering: Spas and Relaxation Experiences for Everyone
Everyone deserves to indulge in self care, and lucky for you, we've got a great list of local spas that will make you feel brand new.
After a week of work, or a stretch of grueling travel, we all need to recharge with some much-needed relaxation and self-care. Fortunately, Pittsburgh has a variety of spas and pampering experiences to assist everyone with finding their ideal spot to unwind.
The Health Club & Spa at Fairmont Pittsburgh
Located in the heart of Downtown Pittsburgh, join the post-work crowd for a mani-pedi or a relaxing steam in the Eucalyptus room designed to open breathing passages and relieve congestion. The Muscle Melt Massage features the use of rosemary, black pepper and ginger to relax tension. Select from a traditional list of spa services that‚Äôll surely offer the highest levels of relaxation!

Try their Chai Spice Body Scrub treatment or step into their cedar lined private sauna for a cleansing sweat. Add CBD oil, aromatherapy or cupping to any of their services.

LEVITY Float Therapy Studio
Located in Squirrel Hill, LEVITY is a different kind of relaxation experience. Only specializing in sensory deprivation tanks, you‚Äôll find serenity and weightlessness waiting for you here. Clients start the experience by showering under a cascading rain showerhead, before climbing into a sensory deprivation pod that holds less than a foot of water, but hundreds of pounds of dissolved Epsom salt for buoyancy. Once the pod lid is closed, floaters experience a feeling of bliss as all of their muscles relax in the supporting water.
Pro tip: Give it a few days after your last shave/wax before you enjoy this treatment; the salt water may sting.
