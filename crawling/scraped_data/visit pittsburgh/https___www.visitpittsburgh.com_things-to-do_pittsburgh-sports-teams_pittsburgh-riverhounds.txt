Come on you Hounds!
A visit to a Pittsburgh Riverhounds (referred to as The Hounds) game at Highmark Stadium will show you that soccer is a growing sport with an energetic fanbase in the city. Highmark Stadium is a unique stadium where every seat in the house is a good one. With a 5,000-seat capacity, fans can take in the game with one of the best views of the city as a backdrop, cheer along with the supporter’s section or enjoy the luxury boxes! The on-field product is pretty good too; The Hounds have made the playoffs in the USL Championship every year since 2018.
Be sure to check out the
Riverhounds’ official website
for their schedule, tickets, stadium information, pro shop and so much more. Riverhounds’ games are a great environment for families and die-hard sports fans alike.
