Allow enough time - spend at least a half day at each school you're interested in attending.
Create an itinerary - budget your time and create a plan.
Plan something special - leave time for fun! Go to a ball game or on a hike, have dinner Downtown, see a show.
Remain objective
Interview the school. Relax, be yourself and come up with a good list of questions.
Get lost - venture to where the action is. Talk to students. Attend a class. Get a true sense of the personality and offerings of the school.
Take good notes and lots of photos
Study the region - half of your education will happen outside the classroom and off-campus.
Be realistic - seek comfort, not perfection.
