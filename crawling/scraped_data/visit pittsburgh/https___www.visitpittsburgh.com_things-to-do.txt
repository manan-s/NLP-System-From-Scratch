Inclines and trolleys and riverboats (oh my)! There are so many ways to
tour and sightsee
around the city of Pittsburgh.
You can take a
tour
by bike, trolley, boat, jet ski, kayak, funicular, bus or Segway, or go old fashioned and explore on your own two feet. Take a ride on the historic
Duquesne Incline
for panoramic views of the city's skyline and rivers.
Outdoor enthusiasts
can hike, bike and picnic at the numerous
parks and green spaces
, including
Schenley Park
and
Point State Park
.
Our recommendation? Pick one of our
90 neighborhoods
that make the city unique and explore.
