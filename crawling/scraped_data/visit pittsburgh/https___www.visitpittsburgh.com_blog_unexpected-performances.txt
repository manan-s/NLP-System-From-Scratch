Unexpected Performances
Don't miss a performance by one of these completely unexpected and innovative theater companies.
All the city's a stage in Pittsburgh. Seriously. Cutting-edge
Quantum Theatre
performs throughout the city in non-traditional spaces. Think cemetery, park or parking garage. And then think: wildly entertaining. The intense and modern
Attack Theatre
combines dance, original live music and multimedia art forms in traditional and nontraditional spaces as well.
Downtown's newest destination for all things comedy is
Arcade Comedy Theater
. The nonprofit theater is an intimate 75-seat space hosting stand-up comedians, improvisational artists, sketch shows, variety acts and humorous performers of all types.
Pittsburgh Playwrights Theatre
develops and showcases the works of local playwrights, from accomplished masters like August Wilson to promising new talents. Performances happen in the penthouse at 937 Liberty Avenue in the Cultural District.
Catch a performance of
Squonk Opera
...you won't be disappointed! Each performance features original music, design, staging and definite outside-the-box thinking. Just to give you an idea, their first show was created more than 20 years ago in a Pittsburgh junkyard.
Other cutting-edge theater groups that are well worth watching include
Stage 62
, performing in the Andrew Carnegie Free Library in Carnegie; the
No Name Players
in Mt. Lebanon;
Off the Wall
in Carnegie;
Prime Stage Theatre Company
, performing at the New Hazlett Theater on the North Side; and
Barebones Productions
, located in Braddock.
