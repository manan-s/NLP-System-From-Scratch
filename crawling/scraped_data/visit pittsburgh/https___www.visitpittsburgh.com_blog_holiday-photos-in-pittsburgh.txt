As part of the
Pittsburgh Downtown Partnership's
holiday events and activities, be sure to stop by the
Holiday KidsPlay Selfie Garden
for a safe and kid-friendly photo opportunity! Located at the Heinz Hall Courtyard, the Selfie Garden features colorful backdrops and standees of popular characters from Fred Roger Productions’ children’s shows. The Selfie Garden is open daily from Nov. 27-Dec. 23 and is free and available for you to explore at your own pace, providing safe and accessible outdoor photo fun.
Downtown
Enjoy a unique, photogenic shopping experience in
Market Square
! The
Peoples Gas Holiday Market™
inspired by the original German Christkindlemarkts (“Christmas Markets”), brings a cherished European tradition to Pittsburgh. Small businesses will be placed in chalets around the festive and highly decorated Market Square, creating plenty of opportunities for fun, holiday-themed photos.
Other great stops Downtown include PPG Plaza, where a giant illuminated tree serves as the centerpiece as ice skaters zip around and gingerbread houses fill windowfronts. Make sure to head to the sister bridges leading from Downtown to the North Shore; they are now permanently lit providing an evening glow perfect for pics that will wow.

Fairmont Pittsburgh
Downtown Pittsburgh’s
Fairmont Pittsburgh
takes a modern twist on traditional holiday décor, offering a festive background for your holiday photos. Starting in mid-November, the lobby is fully decorated for the holidays with bright lights and a giant white Christmas tree, creating a cozy and Instagrammable atmosphere.
GLOWLAND
Schenley Plaza comes aglow with different light-up sculptures and interactive artworks that fill this space with holiday cheer each year in the heart of
Oakland
. I took some of my favorite wintry photos at
GLOWLAND
in previous years, plus you're just a minute walk away from the Cathedral of Learning and Heinz Chapel, both of which make stunning backdrops for photos when it snows!
Pittsburgh Botanic Gardens
Tunnels of illuminated stars. Moroccan lanterns hung from trees. Ponds filled with beacons of light. 2,000+ illuminated flowers.
Pittsburgh Botanic Garden
is a can't-miss for fantastic holiday photos with so many ideas for backgrounds, macro photos and beautiful bokeh guarantee you're going home with great content.

Holiday Pop-Ups
Shooting outdoors and in low light can be tricky, but a great way to get stellar indoor Christmas shots is to head to
holiday pop-up bars
throughout the city. Barcadia has a selfie station set up right in front of their Home Alone-inspired theme, the rooftop of Il Tetto is sparking with holiday lights, and Christmas ephemera fills Miracle on 6th. Turn on portrait mode and get those perfect shots.
Carnegie Museums
Skip the photo in front of your tree this year and head to ours instead!
Carnegie Museum of Art
fills their Hall of Architecture with towering fir trees trimmed to perfection each year, each of which is perfect for a family photo op! And be sure to pause for a photo with Dippy the Dino right outside the Carnegie Museum of Natural History who is decked out in his wintry best.
Pick a Neighborhood
One of the best parts of Pittsburgh is that you have 90 unique
neighborhoods
to choose from if you prefer to just grab some authentic shots from the sidewalks. The Mexican War Streets area of the NorthSide always has great decorations from the residents, the shops in
Lawrenceville
and Shadyside make the walk through them a winter wonderland or catch the buzz of holiday shopping with our vibrant
Strip District
of local merchants, fish markets and international grocers.
