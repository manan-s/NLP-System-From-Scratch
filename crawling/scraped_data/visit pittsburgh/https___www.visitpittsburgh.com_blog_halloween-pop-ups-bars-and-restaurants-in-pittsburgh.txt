Halloween Year Round
These Pittsburgh spots don't change up the decor, unless it's to make things even eerier. Here are a few places where it's always spooky season with Halloween-themed
bars
,
coffee shops
and
breweries
where it's Halloween 12 months a year.
Harold's Haunt 👻
If you want to ditch the bedsheet ghosts and instead see the real deal, be sure to check out Harold's Haunt in
Millvale
, a haunted they-bar in a supportive, inclusive environment. Ask about their resident ghost as you sip on a Hocus Pocus potion (non-alcoholic fauxtions also available) or down a seasonal shot. With a packed event calendar of Witchy Wednesdays, watch parties, full moon gatherings and more, there's always a reason for a return visit.

Jekyl & Hyde 🗡️
Ask any local about Halloween bars and they're sure to point you to Jekyl & Hyde on the
South Side
. This haunt has been all Halloween seven days a week since the 90s, and is always on the top of my list to take my friends when they visit from out of town. Be sure to say hello to the life-size Michael Myers who stalks this bar with regularity, order from their Cocktails for the Recently Deceased menu for inventive and delicious drinks, and pop in those plastic fangs for the full experience.

Grim Wizard Coffee 🤘 🧙‍♂️
Doom metal and delicious coffee combine at the new Grim Wizard Coffee in Allentown, a continuation of the same concept Black Forge coffee started in the same space back in 2016. This gathering point for Pittsburgh's noteworthy metal community is perfect for those who love Halloween year-round, with Munsters and Elvira pinball cabinets to play, brutal vibes decorating the shop and caffeinated alchemy like the Ritual Rites, an espresso latte with dark chocolate, toasted marshmallow and cinnamon shaken with ice and cream (it appropriately costs $6.66 😈)
