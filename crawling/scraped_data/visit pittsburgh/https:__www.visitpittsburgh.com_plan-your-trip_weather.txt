Did you know?
You don't need the Weather Channel to know the forecast in Downtown Pittsburgh. You can tell just be looking up at the
Gulf Tower
!
The tower is an art-deco skyscraper, in the style of a mini-Empire State Building. The pyramid at the top illuminates colors at night according to weather conditions and can be seen for miles. If it's black and gold, you'll know that one of the city's pro sports teams just brought home a winner!
The tower's vibrant colors indicate temperature, humidity, precipitation and wind speed in Pittsburgh at that particular time. For a breakdown and color code, check out this guide from Pittsburgh's local news source,
The Incline
