Tour the 'Burgh
Here are a few unique ways to get a great sense of the city.
There are so many amazing ways to immerse yourself in Pittsburgh. If you like to be active and walk, bike, or run, we've got the tours for you. If cruising, boating, or riding a bus is more your speed, we have you covered too. If you're a Pittsburgher, experience your city in a new way and if you're a visitor, go on a tour you will never forget! Here are a few of our favorite ways to see the city.
Bike (or Walk!) The 'Burgh Tours
Bike the 'Burgh
specializes in multiple tour themes, including a Hollywood of the East tour. The tours are all levels (no Pittsburgh hills involved) and you can bring your own or bike or use one of theirs. Bike the 'Burgh is located at the
David L. Lawrence Convention Center
. The cost of tours vary and for more information or to schedule visit their
website
.
A sister tour,
Walk the 'Burgh
, is perfect if you aren't a cyclist but want to see Pittsburgh. Walk the 'Burgh offers the same routes and tours with additional ones including a public art tour. With Walk the 'Burgh you also get to tour some of the insides of buildings for a unique experience.

Segway Tour
A more futuristic way to tour Pittsburgh is by way of Segway. There are a few Segway Pittsburgh tours including one of
Acrisure Stadium
, and one of Pittsburgh at nighttime. If you've never ridden a Segway before, don't let that stop you. Everyone watches a safety video and receives other training before you get on the Segway. Segway Pittsburgh is located at Station Square, and ensures a safe ane memorable experience!
