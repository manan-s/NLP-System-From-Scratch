How to Ride the Pittsburgh Inclines
Inclines, commonly known as Funiculars Railways, can be found all over the world and throughout history.
It's a question we get asked all the time. So, we're giving you the low-down on going up.
These railways are designed to transport people and cargo up and down steep slopes. And if there is one thing Pittsburgh has, it's steep slopes. You've probably noticed the iconic Pittsburgh Inclines that make our skyline so unique.
The Difference Between Pittsburgh's Two Inclines
The Duquesne Incline
(pronounced "doo-KANE") has red cars and is visible from The Point, while The Monongahela Incline (commonly called "The Mon Incline") has yellow cars and can be seen from the South Shore.

Incline History
Originally opened in the 1870s to service those who lived on Mount Washington, the two inclines that remain in use are the last of four that served the
Mt. Washington area
. Today, they have become more than just a means of transportation. They are still used by local commuters to enter
downtown
, but they have evolved into our favorite way to show off the city skyline.

Frequently Asked Questions
How much are incline tickets?
Both inclines cost
$2.50 one way
. The Mon Incline is $3.50 for a roundtrip ticket, and Duquesne Incline $5 roundtrip with certain discounts for children and senior citizens. Tickets can be purchased at the upper or lower station for both inclines. The Monongahela Incline will accept credit cards, but the Duquesne Incline is exact cash only.
Can I Use A Connect Card to Ride the Incline?
The inclines are public transportation, so Pittsburgh Regional Transit Connect Cards work to pay for a trip as well. If you don't have a Connect Card, the Mon Incline will accept credit cards, but the Duquesne Incline is exact cash only.
Pro Tip:
Use the PRT App on your smartphone to buy your Incline tickets. On the App, tickets are $2.75 and valid for unlimited trips for 3 hours total on both Inclines.
When are the inclines open?
The inclines are open 365 days a year and run approximately every 5 minutes. Hours are:
Monday through Saturday: 5:30 a.m. to 12:30 a.m.
Sundays and Holidays: 7:00 a.m. to 12:30 a.m.
Finding the Inclines
To find these historic landmarks, cross the Monongahela river (the one south of Downtown) by either the Smithfield Street or Fort Pitt Bridge and enter Pittsburgh’s South Shore. You will find the lower stations of both inclines where you can purchase ride tickets.
Which Incline Is Better?
The two inclines both scale the side of
Mount Washington
and both have equally stunning views. We can't tell you which one is better, because we love them both so much! You really can't go wrong with either choice.

At the upper station on Mt. Washington, you an enjoy scenic lookout platforms or enjoy a walk along Shiloh St. to enjoy DiFiore's ice cream with the kids or a nice lunch at
Redbeard's
or Coughlin's Law.
Things to Do Near The Duquesne Incline
The
Duquesne Incline
is located down the street on W Carson Street just west of the Fort Pitt Bridge in view of Point State Park and has a provided parking lot. This incline carries you to an Observation Deck that USA Today Weekend Magazine described as one of the “10 most beautiful views in America.”
Once you get to the top, you'll find more than an
Instagram-worthy vie
. Both upper incline stations also provide historical exhibits to browse through while waiting between rides. And why not make a day of it? Strolling around Mt Washington is
a great way to spend an afternoon
. Be sure to check out some of the awesome dining options!
