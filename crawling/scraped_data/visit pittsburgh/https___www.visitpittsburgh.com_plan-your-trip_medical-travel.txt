​Welcome to Pittsburgh!
For individuals and families traveling to Pittsburgh for medical reasons, whether for treatment or procedures, Pittsburgh is a caring place with high quality
health care
in abundance.
We realize that you must have a lot on your mind. The last thing that you need to be concerned with is
where to stay
,
how to get around
or even just
how to stay busy
.
We hope you are as comfortable as you possibly can be and, while this may not be your permanent home, we consider you our new neighbors. If you are here for an extended stay or just need some time away from the hospital, feel free to explore all Pittsburgh has to offer, from
Family Fun
and
Sporting Events
to a
night at the theater
or a
Gallery Crawl
.
