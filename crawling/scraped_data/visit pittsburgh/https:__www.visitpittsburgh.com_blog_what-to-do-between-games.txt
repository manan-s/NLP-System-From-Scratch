Things To Do Between Sporting Events in Pittsburgh
Coming to Pittsburgh for the big game? Here’s an insider’s guide to some cool, local hotspots not to miss while you're here.
In case you get to town early for a football game, or hockey game, or if you find you have some free time in-between sessions of your favorite collegiate tournament, we have a couple of ideas for what to do or where to go.
Hungry? Maybe feeling a little touristy? Here’s a few ways to spend your time in the ‘Burgh!
Downtown Pittsburgh
Pittburgh's food scene is varied and delicious, with international flavors and neighborhoods filled with
top-rated restaurants
and multiple James Beard Award nominees. Our
beer scene
isn't bad either, and we were ranked the
best city
for suds in 2022.
Downtown Pittsburgh
alone has hundreds of dining establishments that can satisfy every craving. The hub of most downtown activity lies in
Market Square
, where you'll find
City Works
. With more than 15 flat screen TV’s,
30+ local breweries
featured and an energetic, lively atmosphere, City Works provides the ultimate sports bar experience.
But if you had something else in mind, take a walk on Penn Avenue and stop into the dozens of restaurants that line the street including
August Henry’s Burger Bar
or Sienna Mercato. You also don't want to miss
The Standard Market & Pint House
, which offers great grub, a self serve beer wall (yes, you read that right) and vintage arcade games.

Lawrenceville
Located just three miles from Downtown, a short Uber ride will place you in one of Pittsburgh’s trendiest neighborhoods,
Lawrenceville
.
Butler Street is lined with popular bars and restaurants like the award-winning
Burgh’ers Brewing
and
Industry Public House
. Offering one of the best craft beer selections in the city and some delicious American-style comfort food, Industry has something for everyone to enjoy.
Serving homestyle comfort food,
Walter's BBQ Southern Kitchen
is a neighborhood favorite and features a special brunch menu on the weekends.
With some extra time on hand, be sure to check out
The Clemente Museum
, offering the largest collection of baseball Hall of Famer Roberto Clemente memorabilia in the world. Be sure to call ahead, because the museum is open for tours by appointment only!
North Shore
Most famous for its iconic sports venues – Heinz Field and PNC Park – the
North Shore
offers no shortage of places to find a good pub and grub in between sessions. You can also enjoy popular and delicious options such as
Burgatory
,
Bar Louie and
Southern Tier Brewery
.
No games at the stadiums that day? No problem. Schedule a tour of
PNC Park
, one of the best classic ballparks in the world, or tour the
Steelers Hall of Honor
and re-live six Super Bowls and iconic moments with interactive exhibits.

Station Square
A beautiful 52-acre riverfront complex,
Station Square
offers plenty of dining, nightlife and entertainment options for everyone. Catch the game or match at
Hard Rock Café Pittsburgh
or
Homerun Harrys
, featuring 26 flat screen TVs plus pool tables and darts.
Hoping to see Pittsburgh from a different view? Climb aboard either the
Duquesne Incline
or
Monongahela Incline
and head to the top of Mount Washington to take in incredible views of the city skyline. Or, come aboard the
Gateway Clipper
for a majestic riverboat ride around our three rivers.

Strip District
If you’re looking for a taste of authentic Pittsburgh, look no further than the
Strip District
, home to the original
Primanti Brothers
since 1933. It’s a foodie heaven that is authentic and bursting with local flavor. A trip to the ‘burgh isn’t complete without a Primanti Brothers signature sandwich. This sandwich is topped with French fries and secret recipe coleslaw, and has been featured in every Food Network show imaginable.
Other Pittsburgh staples include
Pamela’s Diner
,
Roland’s Seafood Grill
and
The Beerhive
!
