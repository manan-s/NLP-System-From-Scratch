Pittsburgh Fall Date Ideas
Cozy up with that special someone on these fall-themed date nights
It's finally fall! If you're in need of a
spooky
-,
pumpkin spice
- or harvest-themed date night idea, Pittsburgh has you covered. There's only so much time before the
fall festivities
turn into reindeer games, so make the most out of fall with these Pittsburgh date night ideas.
Hayrides and Pumpkin Patches
Pittsburgh is surrounded with
farmers markets
, and
there's no better time to visit than the fall
. Head to
Trax Farms
,
Soergels Orchards
, or
Shenots
(to name a few) for the ultimate fall-time date. Pittsburgh offers plenty of festivals to carve a pumpkin, get “lost” in a corn maze or go on a hayride. If you are not sure which one to check out, take a look at our
Fall Festivals Guide
Hold Me (For Dear Life) Date Night
Not for the weak-hearted, Pittsburgh is a top spot for
haunts
and the go-to escape for
haunted house
enthusiasts. This date night will test your relationship (and survival skills) as you enter Pittsburgh's ultimate haunted houses, including
Hundred Acres Manor
bringing the screams, or
Zombies of the Corn
which arms you with a paintball gun and lets you fight back against the zombie horde.

Halloween Events in Pittsburgh
Phantom Fall Fest
If you're an adventure-seeker or just a kid at heart, you'll want to explore
Phantom Fall Fest
at Kennywood. Come early and ride the Phantom's Revenge and other scream-inducing rides, then stick around after dark for phantoms stalking you through haunted houses and scare zones! This is the perfect date night complete with white-knuckle roller coasters, devilishly good food and spine-tingling fun.
For Horror Film Lovers
Pittsburgh's horror heritage is unmatched. It's where zombie movies first made their mark, bursting out of their graves and onto the scene with Pittsburgh filmmaker
George Romero's Night of the Living Dead and Dawn of the Dead
. Plan a zombie-infested date night seeking out
filming locations
before binging these made in PGH flicks.
If you can't get enough of scary movies, then head straight to
Bierport
bottle shop and
Rowhouse
cinema for date night. Bierport's taproom is now open seven days a week, so find a new favorite (bonus for going local), then bring it to the other side of the building into Rowhouse for your horror film of choice.
DIY Fall Candles
There's nothing like filling your house with the sweet smell of fall. At
Mix Candle Co.
in Pittsburgh, you can create your very own custom candle. You start out by selecting your scents with the expert candle makers and then proceed with making the candle. This is a great way to start your date night and, while your candle is drying, you can pop over to any of the surrounding Lawrenceville bars or restaurants.

Makers Activities
If the candle and paint date night ideas are passé for you, don't worry. Pittsburgh has tons of ways to stay active and create together so you go home with something truly one-of-a-kind.
Take a
jewelry making or wood class
with Contemporary Craft, create your own
custom scents
with Galimard,
forge a ring
with the expert blacksmiths at The Barefoot Forge or sign up for a
Make-It-Now
workshop at Pittsburgh Glass Center to take home coasters, cups and even blown glass pumpkins!

It's Showtime
Sure, summer is great, but fall is when the Cultural District really comes to life! Our
fall 2024 season of shows
includes the PNC Broadway in Pittsburgh productions of Hamilton, & Juliet and MJ the Musical, plus productions from the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra,
Pittsburgh Opera
, Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre, Liberty Magic and more! Add in national touring
comedians
and
immersive theatre
options, and this is the best time of the year to attend a show.
FYF: Find Your Festival
I'll be honest, I plan my date night activities right from our
fall festivals page
. Seemingly every weekend there is something new and different to enjoy including pumpkin festivals,
Pittsburgh Irish Festival
, fall foliage cruises and so much more.
Find somewhere to
eat
and a place to grab a
drink
afterward, and planning your date night takes less than five minutes for a guaranteed good time.
Get Thrifty
The joy of discovery is the reason why thrifting has become such a trendy thing to do in Pittsburgh. You never know what store might hold the perfect piece that's been missing from your wardrobe. Luckily, we developed our
guide to thrifting
in the city to help you find the best bargains, upcycled clothing and eco-friendly creative surplus and supplies stores.
B-Sides Vintage in Millvale
Picnic in the Park
Another reason I love Pittsburgh so much: You don't need to spend a ton on tickets to have a good time. Slow things down and enjoy a date night at one of the
parks
surrounding the city, taking plenty of stops for photos and a blanket for snuggling. Better yet, fill a picnic basket with some of your favorite Pittsburgh foods to snack on as you watch the leaves change.
Take a Walk Around Phipps
Phipps Botanical Gardens is a great spot to walk around with your special someone and see the beautiful fall flowers. Nothing in Pittsburgh adjusts to the seasons like Phipps!
Opening Oct. 5, 2024, see their
Fall Flower Show: Rhythm and Blooms
with magnificent, music-inspired displays of chrysanthemums. Be sure to pause a moment at the Garden Railroad as their new display
Movie Magic
opens that same day with whimsical scenes that will transport you to the big screen.
Pittsburgh Sports, Here We Go
For our couples out there that like watching sports, a
Pittsburgh Penguins
hockey game is a great option. Pens games are exciting, vibrant and capture the magic of a fall day or night in Downtown. College Students: don’t forget to use Student Rush!
If hockey isn't your game, the end of the Pirates and Riverhounds seasons collides with the beginning of Steelers and Pitt Panthers football seasons during fall, making the hardest part of date night getting tickets to these high-energy events.
Make a Fall Beer Tour
Pittsburgh's breweries and beer-centric are celebrated throughout the year, but fall is always an ideal time to discover that new brewery together. Pittsburgh neighborhoods have great breweries around every corner, and fall means it's time for festive new releases like pumpkin stouts, brown ales, porters, stouts and much more along with Oktoberfest celebrations at seemingly every location.
Follow our
beer map
and plan your route for fall flavors.
Dinner and a View
Pittsburgh has so many
great restaurants
and places to take in a nice view, why not combine that into one night? Go to a North Shore restaurant and walk the river trail, or from
Market Square
to the Point, or even from Station Square up the incline to Mt Washington! There are endless combinations to try around the city.
