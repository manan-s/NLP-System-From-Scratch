FAQs
What are the dates for the 2026 NFL Draft?
While you can mark your calendars for Pittsburgh in 2026, specific event dates won’t be announced until 2025.
Where will the 2026 NFL Draft be held?
An exact footprint is yet to be determined, but we believe the NFL is largely interested in incorporating elements of Pittsburgh’s North Shore and Point State Park, while working to engage other key neighborhoods through supporting events. This will be an ongoing process over the next year to determine the best footprint for a seamless Pittsburgh Draft, and we will continue to share updates as details are finalized by the NFL.
What is the estimated economic impact?
The three-day event is expected to draw representatives from all 32 NFL teams, top player prospects from the most iconic football conferences in the nation and hundreds of thousands of attendees. The economic impact of previous Draft destinations has ranged between $120 million to upwards of $165 million.
What is the estimated viewership?
Viewership of the NFL Draft has grown substantially to represent more than 50 million viewers worldwide, which provides an unmatched, near priceless global exposure opportunity for Pittsburgh.
