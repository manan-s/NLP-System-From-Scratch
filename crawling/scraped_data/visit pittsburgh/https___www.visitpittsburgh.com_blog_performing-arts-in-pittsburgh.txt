Performing Arts in Pittsburgh
Experience the arts in Pittsburgh!
The lights fall. The crowd quiets. The curtains go up. If you’re in Pittsburgh, this means you’re about to see an amazing live performance at one of our spectacular theaters.
Pittsburgh is a hub for
cultural adventures
. Nestled in picturesque Downtown, you'll find the vibrant 14-block Cultural District with historic theaters, innovative art galleries and gallery crawls inviting you to see it all in one evening.
But the artistic innovation doesn't stop Downtown. Throughout the city's
90 unique neighborhoods
, you'll find incredible independent companies like South Side's provocative
City Theatre
and outstanding performances throughout
Pittsburgh parks
all
summer
long. We're putting the spotlight on a few places to add to your list as you plan your next live theatre date night, group trip or other vacation idea!
Pittsburgh Opera
Founded by five intrepid women in 1939, the
Pittsburgh Opera
has since become the seventh-oldest opera company in the U.S. With a permanent home at Bitz Opera Factory in the South Side and performances at the spectacular Benedum Center, Pittsburgh Opera puts on world-class live opera year-round while striving to make performances accessible to diverse modern audiences.

Pittsburgh Playhouse
A unique intersection of education, community and the arts, the
Pittsburgh Playhouse
is situated right in Downtown Pittsburgh on the campus of Point Park University. The Conservatory Dance and Conservatory Theatre companies each utilize young artists in training for a wide range of imaginative, contemporary programming each year, while the Playhouse Presents series brings in national artists throughout the year under a central theme.
Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre
For more than five decades,
Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre
has brought its unmatched energy and style to audiences. Performances range from classical, full-length productions to contemporary dance dramas. Plus, seeing their distinctly Pittsburgh production of the Nutcracker is a holiday favorite for locals and out-of-town guests.
Liberty Magic
Located in an intimate, speakeasy-styled performance space,
Liberty Magic
wows and delights audiences with up-close sleight of hand and prestidigitation performances. Each season brings in world renowned magicians around different themes so that each visit is a new, magical experience.

Kelly Strayhorn Theater
Named after Pittsburgh natives and entertainment icons Gene Kelly and Billy Strayhorn,
Kelly Strayhorn Theater
encompasses two venues devoted to diverse, contemporary arts performances. With a focus on emerging artists, LGBTQIA+ and minority groups, guests can enjoy a wide range of performances, classes, workshops and more innovative ways to participate in this Only in Pittsburgh institution.
Even More Arts
Theater
There are a variety of options for those seeking elite theatrical performances.
PNC Broadway
in Pittsburgh spotlights shows destined for or fresh out of NYC, such as Six, Tina and Dear Evan Hansen, on stage in Pittsburgh's ornate downtown theaters. Also in the downtown district,
Pittsburgh CLO
entertains audiences of all ages with diverse productions, including classics from Broadway.
Meanwhile,
avant-garde productions
outside Downtown can be found in the North Shore's
New Hazlett Theater
and
Quantum Theatre
, a company utilizing non-traditional performance spaces throughout the city.
Dance
Pittsburgh is historically known for creating international dance icons like Martha Graham and Gene Kelly, a tradition that continues today. We discussed the Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre above, but there's lots of dance to enjoy!
Delve into a variety of dance genres including modern, contemporary and ballet with the
Pittsburgh Dance Council
, an organization that brings high-profile, dance companies to Pittsburgh. Looking more toward the future of dance? Catch a performance by Point Park University's world-renowned
Dance Conservatory
.

Symphony
Not limited to the visual and theatrical, music is always on stage with the
Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra
. Whether playing a traditional overture or fusing pop music with orchestral sounds, the PSO always delivers an enjoyable night of music at Heinz Hall.
Art for the Eyes
Looking for
visual art
? Visit the global keeper of Andy Warhol's legacy,
The Warhol Museum
, located a short, free light rail (known as "The T") ride from downtown Pittsburgh on the North Shore. Or stay within Downtown's limits, and explore
free galleries
like SPACE or Wood Street Galleries. Don't miss exhibitions that transform entire rooms at the uber-eccentric Mattress Factory or venture to Oakland for the expansive
Carnegie Museum of Art
.
No matter where your taste in art lies, if you're a classic Broadway fanatic or searching for unconventional premieres, Pittsburgh has the
cultural
variety to entertain.
