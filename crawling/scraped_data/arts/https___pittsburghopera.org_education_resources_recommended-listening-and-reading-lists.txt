Our comprehensive Recommended Listening and Reading List for our most recent season was prepared in collaboration with the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh Music Department, with special thanks to Rebekah Hill and Julie Hanify.
View our recommended lists for each opera below. Call numbers indicate holdings of the Music Department, Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh, unless otherwise indicated.
We encourage you to visit the
Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh's website
, and contact their Music Department at 412-622-3105 or
via email
.
Please note that there are other books, CDs, and DVDs beyond this list available at the
Carnegie Library and for purchase at your favorite store.
ADDITIONAL OPERA RESOURCES
Oxford Music Online
- This resource combines the content of The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, The New Grove Dictionary of Opera, The New Grove Dictionary of Jazz, The Oxford Dictionary of Music and The Oxford Companion to Music in one place. A valid Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh card is required. This link will get you there:
carnegielibrary.org/research
(Type Oxford Music into the keyword search box to get to the database.)
Operabase
- This website allows you to search opera performance details of several international opera companies, including upcoming schedules. You can also find information on past performances of thousands of operas, biographies of specific singers and websites of international opera houses.
OperaGlass
- A great resource for plot synopses of operas, libretti, discographies and performance histories. Links to other opera websites are also listed.
YouTube
- Though YouTube is not a specific site for opera research, it offers a wide range of video and sound clips. If you use the titles of any of this season’s operas in a search, you will find several archived performances from stage productions, concerts and more.
