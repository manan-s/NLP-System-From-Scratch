Considering a Gift of Stock?
When people think about making an Annual Fund gift they usually get out their check books. As you assess your tax-deductible donations, consider the wisdom of making this year's Annual Fund gift to the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra from a different asset.

By Donor Advised Fund (DAF)
A donor advised fund (DAF) is a charitable giving program that allows you to combine favorable tax benefits with the flexibility to support your favorite causes.  An increasingly popular charitable vehicle, DAFs are an excellent way to simplify your charitable giving and facilitate your philanthropic goals.  Contributions are tax-deductible and any investment growth in the DAF is tax-free. It is also easy to donate long-term appreciated securities, eliminating capital gains taxes and allowing you to support multiple charities from one block of stock.
