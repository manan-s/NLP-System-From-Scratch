"When you add the debut of the long-awaited new Steinway grand concert piano, special projects and collaborations, it’s going to be an incredible season for everyone."

"Music is the best language in the world—and one that we all speak and love. It is incredibly beautiful to witness the happiness of both our musicians and patrons at Heinz Hall, feeling like they have truly experienced something special together. I look forward not only to new pieces and new voices never heard before on the Heinz Hall stage, but to rediscover favorites which are so compelling. We are tremendously excited to continue bringing these powerful experiences to our beloved audiences next season,” said Manfred Honeck, Music Director of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra.
The Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra’s 2022-2023 popular programming season will be the third under the direction of

“Music is the ultimate healer, rushing in to sweep away the dust of life, capable of initiating and facilitating change. When I think about next season, I think about this superpower that music has to act its magic on us, to bring us together, to bring new levels of joy and fulfillment, and I can’t wait to share it with our community,” said Byron Stripling, Principal Pops Conductor of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra.

The Observer
) performs Beethoven’s Piano Concerto No. 1, a virtuoso showpiece.

The New Yorker
), Igor Levit returns to Pittsburgh with Gershwin’s jazzy Piano Concerto, a work evoking the “young enthusiastic spirit of American life,” as described by Gershwin himself. Then two world premieres top off this already stunning program, including a new orchestral suite arrangement of Strauss’s opera,
Salome
, by Manfred Honeck and a new work by American composer Stacy Garrop to open the program.
