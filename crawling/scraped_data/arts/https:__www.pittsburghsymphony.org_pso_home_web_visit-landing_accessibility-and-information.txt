Special Facilities and Accessibility

The Concierge is happy to assist with information about Heinz Hall, the Cultural District and area attractions, while assisting with dining, hotel, entertainment and transportation concerns.
Our concierge is well-versed in the many opportunities available to patrons either visiting or residing in the Pittsburgh area. Concierge Service begins one hour prior to the concert and is available until after the performance. Call (412) 392-2880 during any performance to speak to a concierge.
