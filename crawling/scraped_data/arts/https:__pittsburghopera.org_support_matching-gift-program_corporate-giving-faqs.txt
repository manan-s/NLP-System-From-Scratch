Matching Gift Frequently Asked Questions
What is a matching gift?
Employee matching gift programs are corporate giving programs.
For example, if you work for Highmark and donate $100 to Pittsburgh Opera, Highmark’s matching gift program has a minimum gift requirement of $100 and matches your gift at a 1:1 ratio. After you submit your matching gift form, Highmark will effectively double your gift by giving $100 to Pittsburgh Opera, as well.
Retirees may also qualify for a match.
It's a quick and easy way to increase the impact of your gift and leverage your company’s support for Pittsburgh Opera.
How do I request a matching gift from my company to the Opera?
Requesting a matching gift is a quick process that you must initiate. You can do this by completing and submitting either a paper form provided by your employer or submitting the information through your company’s electronic submission process. Your company will then send its matching gift to Pittsburgh Opera.
There are typically 3 steps:
1.
Give to Pittsburgh Opera
Make your gift to Pittsburgh Opera and save your tax receipt. Your company’s matching gift program may allow up to one year after you've made your gift for you to request a corporate match.
2.
Search for your company’s matching gift program
Using the search bar below, determine if your company has a matching gift program and review the guidelines and your eligibility. If there are no results for your company, contact your company’s human resource department directly to ask whether they offer a matching gift program.
3.
Submit your Match
There are two ways to submit the matching gift request:
Click on your company's portal link provided in the search results. Log-in and submit your request electronically.
Download your company's matching gift verification form using the link provided in the search results. Print it, fill it out, and send it to Pittsburgh Opera.
