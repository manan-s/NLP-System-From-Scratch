Carmen
by Georges Bizet / Text for original music by Sandra Seaton. Based on a true story. • April 27, 30 & May 3,5, 2024
Byham Theater
Pittsburgh’s unsung heroine who taught America to sing
In 1943, the National Negro Opera Company is set to perform on a floating barge to evade racially-segregated venues. But when bad weather threatens—pushing the performance to a segregated performance hall—visionary impressaria Mary Cardwell Dawson must find a way forward.
Mary Cardwell Dawson’s dream to provide access for African Americans to perform on stages for all audiences changed the future of opera. Having founded the longest-running, all-Black opera company here in Pittsburgh and organizing opera guilds in the country’s biggest cities, Mary Cardwell Dawson would go on to train hundreds of African American youth to sing.
Written by Mark Twain Award-winning playwright and librettist
Sandra Seaton
,
The Passion of Mary Cardwell Dawson
celebrates the remarkable founder of Pittsburgh’s historic and groundbreaking National Negro Opera Company. This play with music includes selections from
Carmen
as well as original music by award-winning Kennedy Center Composer-in-Residence
Carlos Simon
.

SYNOPSIS: CONTAINS SPOILERS
Synopsis - contains spoilers!
Summer 1943. Mary Cardwell Dawson’s rehearsal studio. The National Negro Opera Company is preparing to present two operas at the outdoor Watergate Concert Barge in Washington, D.C. For the company’s ambitious schedule, La traviata was performed on the first night with the great soprano Madame Lillian Evanti. However, the damp weather was unsuitable, and the attendance was disappointing.
Madame Mary Cardwell Dawson meets with the singers who will perform the leads in a planned performance of Carmen: Frank (Don José), Isabelle (Micaëla), and Phoebe (Carmen). Fearing the rain will again keep the audience away, Madame Dawson inquires about renting a concert hall. While the hall manager agrees to rent to the NNOC, he informs Madame Dawson that the venue has a policy of segregated seating.
The future of the company hangs in the balance: according to the Union agreement, the artists and other personnel must be paid, whether the concert takes place or not. An outdoor performance in the rain is sure to be a disappointment, but an indoor performance with segregated seating is unacceptable.
The young singers, eager to make their mark, urge Madame Dawson to consider the hall. She initially will not hear it, but as rehearsals continue and the weather worsens, she has moments of doubt. The Union board, expecting a breach of contract, demands she leave rehearsal for an emergency meeting. When they insult her, she fights back and is taken to jail. After Madame Dawson is bailed out, Madame Dawson returns to rehearsal, bruised but undaunted.
The young singers realize that Madame Dawson’s life—her determination and struggle—is the greatest lesson she has for them. They tell her they will sing in the rain if necessary. Just as they resolve to go forward, the rain stops.
