Violinist Lorien Benet Hart has been a member of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra since 2001. Her previous positions include assistant concertmaster in both the Charlotte and Windsor Symphony Orchestras. The summers often find her in Jackson Hole, WY where she has been a member of the Grand Teton Music Festival since 1995.
Lorien Benet Hart holds a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of California at Berkeley and a Master of Music degree from the University of Michigan. She has studied under Murray Adaskin, Sidney Humphreys, Anne Crowden, Emanuel Hurwitz and Paul Kantor.
When not on stage, Hart can be found volunteering for 412 Food Rescue, a Pittsburgh non-profit that addresses food waste and food insecurity. She was recognized by the League of American Orchestras in 2021, receiving the Ford Musicians Award for her work spearheading the Musicians of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra’s “Body & Soul” partnership with 412 Food Rescue.
