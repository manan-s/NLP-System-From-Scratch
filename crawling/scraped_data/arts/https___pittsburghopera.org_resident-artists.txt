Hailed as one of the country's leading training programs for young artists, Pittsburgh Opera’s Resident Artist Program provides professional development during a two-year session.
The Program
Each year, exceptional young singers are selected by audition from more than 800 applicants.
While honing their vocal skills and expanding their repertoire,
Resident Artist Singers
study languages, diction, movement, and acting. Performance opportunities include principal roles in fully-staged Resident Artist productions, comprimario roles and principal cover roles in Pittsburgh Opera mainstage productions.
The
Resident Artist Stage Director
serves as Director for a resident artist production, Assistant Director for all mainstage operas, and stages Song Shop Concerts and other events throughout the season.
The
Resident Artist Pianist
serves as a rehearsal pianist, orchestra pit pianist for select productions, accompanies community engagement events, and receives invaluable mentorship from Pittsburgh Opera’s Music Director and Music Staff.
Watch this video to hear from current and past Resident Artists, and Pittsburgh Opera Artistic staff, about the program:
Resident Artists perform comprimario roles on the main stage.
Resident Artists perform lead roles in our baroque and Second Stage productions.
Our Resident Artists perform in our Song Shop concerts, which are free and open to everyone.
Resident Artists are also the headliners at our formal fundraising events such as Maecenas and Diamond Horseshoe Ball.
The Resident Artists entertain kids and their families at Children's Hospital at holiday time.
