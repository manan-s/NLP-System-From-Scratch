Legacy gifts have been a major source of support for the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra's
Endowment
for many years. You don't have to be wealthy to make a meaningful and lasting gift. Unless directed otherwise by a donor, the Symphony adds estate gifts to its permanent endowment where the principal remains untouched and a percentage of the earnings support the annual operations of the Orchestra.
Although bequests are the most popular and easiest to structure of the estate provisions, we also encourage donors to remember the Orchestra when assigning beneficiaries of life insurance, retirement accounts and charitable trusts. Your professional advisor(s) may recommend other vehicles which could provide financial or tax advantages based on your circumstances.
We invite patrons who intend to leave a planned gift to the Orchestra to join our
Steinberg Society
, named in honor of legendary conductor William Steinberg (1952-1976). We don't require that you provide details about your gift, but appreciate any information you are comfortable sharing. Of course we will also assure your privacy if you prefer anonymity.
We hope that if you decide to leave a gift to the Pittsburgh Symphony through your will or trust that you will let us know. Steinberg Society members are invited to an intimate brunch in the Mozart Room annually for a private musical performance.
If you'd like more information about how your planned gift can support the Pittsburgh Symphony, please contact Camilla Brent Pearce, Senior Gift Planning Officer at (412)392.4842 or
cpearce@pittsburghsymphony.org
.  The Pittsburgh Symphony's EIN number is 25-0986052.
