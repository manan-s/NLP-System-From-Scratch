Sensory-Friendly
The Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra is committed to providing an environment that is inclusive and welcoming to all patrons. Each year, we host a sensory friendly performance that is customized especially for those with autism spectrum disorders or who have other disabilities that create sensory sensitivities. In addition to our annual sensory friendly concert, all
Fiddlesticks
and
Schooltime concerts
also have sensory friendly accommodations available. Please ask your ticketing representative for more information or call us at 412-392-4900.
What is a sensory friendly performance?
Sensory friendly performances are musical experiences customized especially for patrons with autism spectrum disorders or other disabilities that create sensory sensitivities. Designed in consultation with leading occupational therapy experts, sensory friendly performances provide an opportunity for patrons of all ages to engage in multisensory pre-concert activities and enjoy a symphony concert together with family and friends in a relaxed, inclusive environment.
Modifications typically available at sensory friendly performances include:
- Mitigation of sudden, loud sounds
- Low-level lighting throughout the performance
- Fidgets, earplugs, and noise-cancelling headphones
- Patrons are welcome to leave and re-enter the concert hall throughout the performance
- 100% refund policy for families that are unable to attend, including last-minute changes
- Designated quiet area with relaxing activities
- Family restroom
- Patrons are welcome to talk, clap, sing, and move throughout the performance
- Heinz Hall staff trained to be especially inclusive and accommodating to patron needs
- When concessions are offered, gluten and casein-free options
- Materials to help families prepare for their Heinz Hall experience
For questions about sensory friendly performances, please ask your ticketing representative or call Heinz Hall at 412-392-4900.
