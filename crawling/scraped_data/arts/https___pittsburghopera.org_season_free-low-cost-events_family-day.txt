Our next Family Day event will be held on March 1, 2025, 10:00 AM- 1:00 PM.
Each Family Day event consists of different activities designed to expose children, teens, and their families to some of the many different components that make up opera. Family Day activities in the past have included:
Instrument Show and Tell
, where volunteers from the
Pittsburgh Youth Symphony Orchestra
(PYSO) will show, discuss, and demonstrate the wide range of musical instruments often found in an opera’s orchestra.
A
voice lesson
led by a member of Pittsburgh Opera. Children will learn about different voice types, how to use proper breath support, how to project their voices, and more.
Dance/Movement/Choreography
– the experts from
Attack Theatre
will explain and demonstrate different kinds of dancing and creative movement, as well as discuss the art of choreography
Prop making
– Opera productions use a wide range of props, which are generally small items carried or used by performers on stage. Children will learn what goes into making common opera props, and will even make their own.
Participants will rotate throughout the four activities. Each participant and group will participate in all four activities.
There is no minimum age to attend. Parents/guardians must accompany children younger than high school age, so they can enjoy the activities with their children.
Each family will receive a free goody bag at the end of the event.
Family Day activities culminate in a live performance by Pittsburgh Opera’s award-winning
Resident Artists
. This concert may be open to the general public as well as Family Day attendees.
“We are thrilled to have our inaugural Family Day,” says Pittsburgh Opera’s Director of Community Engagement and IDEA Initiatives Rebekah Diaz. “It’s a great way to give access to the performing arts, in a safe environment to welcome new audiences to this great artform. Whether you’re young or young at heart, this promises to be a fantastic experience. We look forward to making this an annual tradition.”
