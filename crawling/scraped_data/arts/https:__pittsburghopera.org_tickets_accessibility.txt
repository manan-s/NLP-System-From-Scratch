Striving for accessibility throughout the organization
Pittsburgh Opera strives for accessibility in its performances, performance spaces, communications, and at the Bitz Opera Factory in the Strip. We have also been a leader in offering accessibility services, such as
Audio Commentary
and Braille program books, at performances.
Inclusion at Pittsburgh Opera
Pittsburgh Opera is committed to including all staff, patrons, and volunteers in all performances and programs. We consciously use person-centered language and strive to raise awareness about positive interactions. We welcome persons with disabilities as volunteers. We aim for full participation, inclusion, and integration of people of all abilities into the fabric of the company.
CAPTIONING/SUPERTITLES
All operas, including those performed in English, include Supertitles (English texts) projected onto a screen above the stage. These are sometimes referred to as "OpTrans".
AUDIO COMMENTARY
Pittsburgh Opera offers an audio description service for patrons with visual, hearing, and print impairments during most Tuesday performances at the Benedum Center, August Wilson African American Cultural Center, Pittsburgh CAPA (Creative and Performing Arts) School, and at the Bitz Opera Factory.
Audio description service is also offered at Art Song Recitals in the Bitz Opera Factory. Through Assistive Listening Devices, patrons can hear the Supertitles read simultaneously with their appearance on the screen, as well as descriptions of the set, characters, and costumes.
A volunteer team has provided the Audio Commentary service since 2003. Several team members provide individual assistance to patrons as they pick up Assistive Listening Devices. Another team member reads from the program book ten minutes before each act of the performance—the "pre-show". Another team member reads the Supertitles and describes the visual aspects of the stage—the "play-by-play".
Patrons may reserve seats in advance by calling 412-281-0912, ext. 213. Tickets are $12.00 each for patrons with visual impairments and a companion, and consideration will be given in case of financial hardship.
To pick up an Assistive Listening Device at the Benedum Center, a patron presents an ID in the Guest Services Center, located off the far right lobby. To pick up an Assistive Listening Device at the August Wilson African American Cultural Center, CAPA, or at the Bitz Opera Factory, a patron presents an ID at the Education table in the lobby.
ASSISTIVE LISTENING DEVICES
Assistive Listening Devices (ALDs) transmit and/or amplify the sound of a production for anyone with or without a hearing aid.
The Benedum Center has two systems for Assistive Listening: an Infrared system and an Inductive Loop system.
Infrared: Channel 1 on the Infrared Hearing Devices is audio amplification only. Channel 2 on the Infrared Hearing Devices includes music and Audio Commentary
Inductive Loop: If a patron's hearing aid has a Telecoil or Phone Position setting, the hearing aid can be worn and a special headset with an inductive loop system can be used (and worn around the neck). Infrared hearing devices cannot be used in the ears with a hearing aid.
Pittsburgh CAPA Theater and the Bitz Opera Factory have radio systems for broadcasting audio description. These Assistive Listening Devices with radio receivers are set to the frequency of the broadcast. After patrons turn the radio on, they can adjust the volume.
SIGN LANGUAGE INTERPRETATION
Sign language interpretation can usually be arranged upon request.
Requests for sign language interpreters must be received at least two weeks prior to the performance
, and are subject to the availability of an interpreter.
To request an ASL interpreter at a Pittsburgh Opera performance, please
email us
or call 412-281-0912 x216 for details. If you have specific questions, please feel free to ask your ticketing representative or call the Benedum Center directly at 412-456-2600.
Watch the video below to learn how ASL interpreters enhance the performance for patrons, and why ASL conveys things beyond what our supertitles can do.

BRAILLE AND LARGE PRINT PROGRAMS
Large print and Braille programs are available for every performance and may be obtained in the Guest Services Center at the Benedum Center. For performances at the Pittsburgh CAPA Theater and at the Bitz Opera Factory, Braille and Large Print programs may be obtained at the Education table in the lobby.
Patrons who wish to read study guides in advance of performances may
request that their email addresses be added
to the Audio Commentary email updates list.
SENSORY WORKSHOPS
Sensory Workshops are held for select productions at the Bitz Opera Factory in the Strip. These workshops examine the story, the music, and the background of the opera. Participants will have a chance to explore the scenery, props, and costumes. Workshops are conducted by the Education Department.
Sensory Workshops are free, but reservations should be made by calling 412-281-0912, ext. 242.
