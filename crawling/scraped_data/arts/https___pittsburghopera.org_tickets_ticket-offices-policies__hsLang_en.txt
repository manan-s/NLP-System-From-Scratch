Benedum Center Safety & Security statement and Bag Policy
The Pittsburgh Cultural Trust has implemented new security and bag policies, effective starting October 1, 2016, at the Benedum Center and their other venues. You can
read their Safety & Security statement
, which includes an
updated list of prohibited items
, and
read their Bag Policy
, on
their website
.
Beware of Ticket Resellers
Pittsburgh Opera's official online ticketing site homepage is
opera.culturaldistrict.org
, which we operate in partnership with the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust's online ticketing site
trustarts.org
.
If you do not see culturaldistrict.org or trustarts.org in the webpage's URL, you are not using our official ticketing website and are likely on a reseller website.
The risks of buying from a reseller include:
You may pay more than face value.
Your tickets may not be real.
Your tickets may not be able to be replaced when lost or stolen.
Pittsburgh Opera cannot give you a refund if you have to cancel, since you did not buy the ticket from us.
Pittsburgh Opera cannot contact you with crucial information on show cancellations, time changes, road closures or traffic updates, upcoming shows or other useful information.
Tickets purchased from unofficial sources are done so at a risk. By purchasing only from opera.culturaldistrict.org or trustarts.org you are assured that the ticket you receive is valid and is being sold to you at current face value.
Resellers go to great lengths to come up first in Google search results, and often use official-sounding names such as "Ticket Network", "Box Office Ticket Sales", "Ticket Smarter", "Ticket City", and so on. Don't be fooled!

TICKETING POLICIES
Late Seating at the Benedum Center
To ensure that all operagoers have a good experience, latecomers will be taken to the best available seat that does not disturb other patrons until intermission. Management accepts no responsibility for the inconvenience and can make no exceptions for late arrivals. Refunds or exchanges are NOT issued to latecomers.
Late Seating at other Venues
Late seating is handled on a show-by-show basis.
Please note that for some of our shows at other venues, including at the Bitz Opera Factory, there is no late seating.
When possible without disrupting the performance, Pittsburgh Opera will make every attempt to accommodate late arrivals. Management accepts no responsibility for the inconvenience and can make no exceptions for late arrivals. Refunds or exchanges are NOT issued to latecomers.
Please allow ample travel time so that if you encounter unexpected traffic, road construction, accidents, full parking garages, etc., you are still able to arrive at the theater for the start of the performance.
Obstructed Vision at the Benedum Center
Supertitles, the English translations projected above the stage, will be fully visible to most Benedum Center customers. However, supertitles will not be visible to anyone seated in row W and behind on the Main Floor, or the side sections of rows W-ZZ on the Main Floor.

An Emergency Register Book is located in the Benedum Center entrance lobby to the right of the entry doors. Refer emergency calls to 412-456-2610. Please turn off pagers, cell phones, and watches during the performance and notify your contact of the emergency number and your seat location.

TICKET INSURANCE WITH BOOKING PROTECT
The Pittsburgh's Cultural District has partnered with
Booking Protect
to provide you peace of mind with your
single ticket purchase
(good for single tickets only; not currently available for subscriptions or group sales). We recommend adding Booking Protect to your order, as without it all single tickets are non-refundable.
Booking Protect costs just 7% of your pre-tax order total and allows you to apply for a full refund should you or anyone in your party be unable to attend due to a qualifying reason such as: contracting COVID-19 (with doctor's note), a family member contracting COVID-19 (with doctor's note), being high-risk with the advice of a doctor not to attend (with doctor's note), other illness, family emergency, or inclement weather.
Full details here.
Claim a refund up to 45 days after your performance date through a simple process exclusively on the Booking Protect website. By adding Booking Protect to your order, you are agreeing to their Terms of Service (
