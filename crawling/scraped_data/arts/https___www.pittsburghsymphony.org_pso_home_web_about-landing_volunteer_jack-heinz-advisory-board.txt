Jack Heinz Advisory Board
Purpose
The Jack Heinz Advisory Board identifies, cultivates and engages corporate and community leadership in Pittsburgh Symphony activities to create advocates throughout the community as well as build a pipeline of future Directors.  Advisory Board members represent up and coming leaders within the Pittsburgh community with a passion for the Symphony. The Advisory Board is a standing committee of the Board of Directors.
Its name honors the memory of H.J. “Jack” Heinz II (1908 – 1987), who was president of the H.J. Heinz Company, chairman of the Howard Heinz Endowment, and visionary leader of the civic push to create Pittsburgh’s cultural district. This ambitious undertaking begin with the rebirth of the Loew’s Penn Theater as Heinz Hall, the new home of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra, in 1971.
Activities
Advisory Board Meetings:
The Advisory Board meets at least 4 times a year to have strategic and generative conversations about challenges and opportunities facing the Pittsburgh Symphony.
