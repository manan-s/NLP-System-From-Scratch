Your opera journey begins today!
Intimidated by opera? Don't be! Let's debunk some common opera myths together!
If you’ve never been to the opera before, you may have some misconceptions. Don't worry, you're not alone! So let's shake off your preconceptions and learn what going to the opera is really like...
MYTH: I'LL HAVE TO WEAR A TUXEDO OR A FANCY BALL GOWN
Come as you are or glam it up!
On weeknights people often show up in what they wore to the office that day, and on Fridays and Sundays, we see everything from dressy to jeans. On Saturdays – opening nights – some like to wear a suit or step out in a special dress. But just wear whatever makes you feel comfortable!
Everyone in this photo is dressed perfectly for the opera! (Photo credit: David Bachman)
MYTH: BUT IT'S SOOOOO EXPENSIVE!
Tickets to Pittsburgh Opera's mainstage shows at the Benedum and Byham start at only $15... children and teens can even get in at half that price. That's less than a movie ticket and some popcorn!
There are even discounts for
groups of 6+
,
students
,
20-Something Tuesdays
and more.
MYTH: I WON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY ARE SAYING
English texts are always projected above the stage, just like subtitles at the movies. While many operas are in Italian, German, or French, there are many in English too. You'll understand every word!
MYTH: OPERA IS BORING!
Do you think sword fights are boring? What about dancing, poisonings, secret plots, epic romances, or twist endings?
Operas have these in spades! That's why the term "operatic" has come to mean "dramatic to the nth degree."
These two will slice your notions of "boring" to threads! (Photo credit: David Bachman)
MYTH: OPERAS ARE TOO LONG
Operas come in all shapes and sizes!
The shortest opera we know of is 13 minutes long, and the longest one takes 7 days! You can find the running time for each opera we present on its main website page, under "Details and Resources." Many operas are the same length as any musical or play, with an intermission or two along the way.
MYTH: ALL OPERA SOUNDS THE SAME
Just like music has changed a lot in the last 400 years, opera has too!
While almost all operas make use of "classical voice technique," which give operas their signature vocal style, the musical style can vary from Baroque to even Hip Hop!

Some rousing 19th century bravado from Carmen (Video credit: RLG creations)
A jazzy number from Charlie Parker's Yardbird (Video credit: RLG Creations)
MYTH: YOU HAVE TO HAVE A PhD TO UNDERSTAND WHAT'S GOING ON
You don’t need to study before you go to the opera any more than you have to study before you go to a movie!
Opera is a performing art meant to be enjoyed as is. For people who want to familiarize themselves with the plot in advance, there is a synopsis on the opera’s webpage and program books. And if you want to nerd out you can go to the
Pre Opera Talk
,
Meet The Artists
, or pick up a
Study Guide
at our education table. But you don’t need to do any of those to enjoy the show and understand what’s happening!
MYTH: OPERAS ARE ALWAYS DEPRESSING
Not so! There are many comic operas, operas for children, and heartwarming love stories too.
While there are operas that will truly break your heart or scare you to your core, opera plays with every human emotion, especially the good ones!
Who doesn't love a happy ending? (Photo credit: David Bachman)
