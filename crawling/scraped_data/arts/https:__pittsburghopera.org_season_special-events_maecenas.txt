EVENT HISTORY
Named for Gaius Maecenas, the wealthy Roman statesman and cultural patron, the Maecenas gala has developed a reputation for a spectacular environment and great entertainment. SEEN hails it as “one of the best black-tie galas in town” and by the Tribune-Review as one of Pittsburgh’s top parties of the year. Each year, this event is a critical aspect of Pittsburgh Opera’s fundraising efforts to keep music alive in Pittsburgh and the surrounding areas.
Annually, Maecenas galas celebrate a successful season for Pittsburgh Opera and recognize individuals who have contributed significantly to the performing arts in Pittsburgh or within their respective fields. Each year, a few worthy recipients receive Awards from Pittsburgh Opera.
