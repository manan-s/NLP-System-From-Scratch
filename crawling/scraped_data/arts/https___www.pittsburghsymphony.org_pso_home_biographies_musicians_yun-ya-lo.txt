Yun-Ya Lo
Cellist
Yun-Ya Lo joined the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra in January 2024. Prior to her appointment, she was pursuing her doctoral degree in cello performance at Indiana University’s Jacobs School of Music under the guidance of Brandon Vamos from the Pacifica Quartet. Previously she studied with Richard Aaron at the Juilliard School, where she earned her Bachelor and Master degrees in five years by completing the BM/MM accelerated program.
Lo has won in several competitions including New York International Artists Competition, IU Concerto Competition, International Music Competition Grand Prize Virtuoso in London, American Protege International Competition of Romantic Music, and Osaka International Music Competition. Yun-Ya has held several recitals in New York, Bloomington, Shanghai, and Taipei with programs that explores a wide range of cello repertoires, from standard repertory to works by lesser-known composers.
She also appears as an active chamber music player and has completed several chamber concert tours in China and Taiwan. In 2020, she performed chamber music concerts in Taiwan alongside established musicians such as David Chan, Philip Setzer, Cho-Liang Lin, Scott Lee, and Dmitri Atapine.
