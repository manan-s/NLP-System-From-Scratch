Double or Triple Your Impact!
Many employers have matching gift programs to match charitable contributions made by their employees. Gifts from retirees may also qualify for a match. Participating in your company’s matching gift program is a great way for you to enable your employer to join with you in supporting your philanthropy to Pittsburgh Opera.
If you are a Pittsburgh Opera volunteer, your company may also have a Volunteer Grant Program.
Please contact
Torey Gricks
for more information about Pittsburgh Opera and increasing your support through leveraging your corporate match, or check out our
Frequently Asked Questions
section below.
Thank you for increasing the impact of your gift through corporate matching.  Your support helps Pittsburgh Opera continue bringing world-class opera and quality arts education programming to Pittsburgh and beyond.
Pittsburgh Opera Matching Information:
Address: 2425 Liberty Ave, Pittsburgh PA 15222

WHAT IS A MATCHING GIFT?
Employee matching gift programs are corporate giving programs.
For example, if you work for Highmark and donate $100 to Pittsburgh Opera, Highmark’s matching gift program has a minimum gift requirement of $100 and matches your gift at a 1:1 ratio. After you submit your matching gift form, Highmark will effectively double your gift by giving $100 to Pittsburgh Opera, as well.
Retirees may also qualify for a match.
It's a quick and easy way to increase the impact of your gift and leverage your company’s support for Pittsburgh Opera.
HOW DO I REQUEST A MATCHING GIFT FROM MY COMPANY TO THE OPERA?
Requesting a matching gift is a quick process that you must initiate. You can do this by completing and submitting either a paper form provided by your employer or submitting the information through your company’s electronic submission process. Your company will then send its matching gift to Pittsburgh Opera.
There are typically 3 steps:
1.
Give to Pittsburgh Opera
Make your gift to Pittsburgh Opera and save your tax receipt. Your company’s matching gift program may allow up to one year after you've made your gift for you to request a corporate match.
2. Search for your company’s matching gift program
Determine if your company has a matching gift program and review the guidelines and your eligibility on your company’s website or contact your company’s human resource department directly to ask whether they offer a matching gift program.
3. Submit your Match
There are two ways to submit the matching gift request:
Click on your company's portal link provided in the search results. Log-in and submit your request electronically.
Download your company's matching gift verification form using the link provided in the search results. Print it, fill it out, and send it to Pittsburgh Opera.

WHAT ARE VOLUNTEER GRANT PROGRAMS?
Volunteer grant programs are corporate giving programs in which companies provide monetary gifts to organizations where employees volunteer regularly
For example, if you volunteer as an usher for our performances, your employer could potentially make a monetary gift for our volunteer time.
I GAVE TO THE OPERA A FEW MONTHS AGO. CAN I STILL APPLY FOR A MATCHING GIFT?
Yes, it's not too late to apply for a matching gift. Your company may even allow you to submit match requests for 1 year following the date of your gift.
CAN MY COMPANY'S MATCHING GIFT BE APPLIED TO SUPPORT AN OPERA EVENT OR TO A TEAM FUNDRAISING GOAL?
Absolutely! Matching gifts are an excellent opportunity to increase event and team fundraising goals. Email
Torey Gricks
for more information.
WHAT IF I STILL HAVE QUESTIONS?
For questions regarding your company's matching gift program policies, please contact your employer's human resource department.
For questions regarding obtaining a tax receipt or submitting and verifying a matching gift request, please email
