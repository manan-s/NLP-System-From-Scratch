Individual Benefits
As part of our donor family, you make our vision of Great Music in Every Life a reality every day. Each year from September 1 - August 31, the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra runs our Annual Fund donation campaign that provides the foundation for us to continue performing at the highest levels while we innovate to engage new audiences, forge new partnerships, and reach deeper into our community.
