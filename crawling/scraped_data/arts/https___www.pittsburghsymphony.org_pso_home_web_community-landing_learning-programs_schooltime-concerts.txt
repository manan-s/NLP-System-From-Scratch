24/25 Schooltime @ Heinz Hall
Introduce students to the orchestra and nurture a love of music! As the United States prepares to celebrate its 250th anniversary, Schooltime at Heinz Hall will travel a two-year curriculum arc focused on the history, culture, and music of our nation. Join the Pittsburgh Symphony as we use music to explore what it means to be American (2024-2025) and what is American music (2025-2026). Each Schooltime unit includes a PSO concert and learning resources developed by the PSO Learning & Engagement team.
Schooltime is provided for free to all schools; registration is required.
All are welcome at Schooltime!
Sensory Friendly, hearing, and mobility accommodations are available at all Schooltime concerts. ASL interpretation will be provided from stage on November 21, January 23, March 13, and May 8. Additional accommodations are available on request (please provide one month's notice); email

What does it mean to be part of a community?
Join the Pittsburgh Symphony for a musical rendition of
Danbi Leads the School Parade
by Anna Kim. Students will meet Danbi, a young girl who learns to embrace her Korean identity as she makes friends in her new American school. Associate Conductor Moon Doh leads the orchestra in a selection of music that illustrates Danbi’s story as she shares what makes her unique. This beautiful story will be read by the author, Anna Kim, as her colorful illustrations of Danbi’s adventures are projected above the stage.
We are delighted to be partnering with local award-winning bookstore

What is an American orchestra?
The Pittsburgh Symphony is excited to announce a special All-American edition of our popular Meet the Orchestra program! This new concert features repertoire by American composers and highlights what makes the American orchestra different, from seating to instrumentation. Students will meet each instrument family of the orchestra, learn how they make sound, hear how instrument families work together to create orchestral music, and even have a chance to be the conductor!
