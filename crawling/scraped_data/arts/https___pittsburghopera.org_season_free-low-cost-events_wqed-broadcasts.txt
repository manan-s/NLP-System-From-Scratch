WQED-FM radio broadcasts are the perfect way to catch up on the
past
and
upcoming
seasons of Pittsburgh Opera.
WQED-FM broadcasts each of Pittsburgh Opera's previous-season productions, in their entirety, in the weeks leading up to our new season's opening night.
If a production was sold out, or you just want to hear your favorite arias again, WQED-FM's broadcasts are a great way to hear these performances. See the schedule below for details.
Hosted by WQED’s Anna Singer, the Pittsburgh Opera Preview Shows are half-hour previews of each upcoming opera
. Each 30-minute Preview Show is broadcast twice before each production opens (the Saturday before opening night, and again the night before opening night), giving listeners an in-depth introduction to the opera’s singers, music, and production.
WQED-FM Re-Cap Shows for our 2023-24 Season:
The Barber of Seville

"'WHERE CAN WE TAKE YOU?' MOMENTS" SEPT. 16-OCT. 4, 2024
As we build up to opening night of
Tosca
, Pittsburgh Opera is opening up our vaults to release daily opera moments on WQED-FM!
Each weekday for three consecutive weeks from Monday, September 16th through Friday October 4th, WQED-FM will be broadcasting a specially selected Pittsburgh Opera audio clip at 5:30PM.
These
"'Where can we take you?' moments"
will take you to such far-flung locales as Seville, Paris, the Black Forest, ancient Egypt, the royal palace of Babylon, and more, all from the convenience of your car or home.
Take a breath of fresh aria on your commute home from work!
2425 LIBERTY AVE.
