Aspire Grant & Development
Aspire Grant & Development (Aspire) is very honored to support the
      Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra (PSO). Realizing the connection between
      mental focus and music, we can often be found listening to the Pittsburgh
      Symphony Radio as we develop a grant! Investment in equitable learning
      programs offered by the PSO offer youth the chance to experience the power
      of music. We have commonality with the PSO, to advance the City of
      Pittsburgh in cultural and economic position.
Michele Miller Beener, President
