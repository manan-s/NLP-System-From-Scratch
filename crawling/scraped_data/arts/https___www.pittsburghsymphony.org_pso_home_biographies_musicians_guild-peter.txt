Peter Guild
Bass
Peter Guild joined the double bass section of the Pittsburgh Symphony in 1999. Previously he had been a member of the Columbus and Toledo Symphonies. He grew up in Carver, Oregon, and took up the cello and bass in the North Clackamas School District string programs where he studied with bassist and string teacher Dave Anderson. Without the music programs in the public schools, it is unlikely that he would have ever played a musical instrument. He later studied with Mount Hood Community College's Larry Zgonc. Guild earned his bachelor's and master's degrees in bass performance from the University of Michigan, where he studied with Stuart Sankey. Other teachers include Steve Molina, Jeff Turner, and electric bass recording legend Carol Kaye.
Peter Guild enjoys arranging and composing music in all genres and teaches double bass orchestral repertoire at Carnegie Mellon University. He is married to Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra violinist Kristina Yoder and is the father of Marty, Sam, Leah and Maggie Guild.
