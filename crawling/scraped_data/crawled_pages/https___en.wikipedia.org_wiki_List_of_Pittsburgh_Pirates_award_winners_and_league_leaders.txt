No-Hitters
On September 20, 1907, Nick Maddox, a 20-year-old rookie, threw the first no-hitter for the Pittsburgh Pirates baseball club. Through 1907 and 1908 Maddox won 20 of his 30 starts, making him the fastest pitcher to ever reach 20 games. This mark will be tied in the future by three other pitchers, but never beaten. Maddox won the third game of the 1909 World Series over Detroit, but was released in 1910 after winning only two games.
The Pirates waited decades later for their next no-hitter, which was delivered by Cliff Chambers against the Boston Braves in Boston, a 3–0 victory, on May 6, 1951. Chambers walked eight and had one wild pitch, and he also drove in the third run in the 8th inning. For Chambers, this was his last victory in a Pirates uniform.
Bob Moose no-hit the New York Mets in New York on September 20, 1969, which became the 5th no-hitter recorded by National League pitchers, a record at the time. Moose later moved into a relief role, and in 1976 led the Pirates in saves.
Dock Ellis might be considered the most notorious no-hitter pitcher. In his autobiography, Dock Ellis in the Country of Baseball, Ellis revealed that he pitched his no-hitter against the San Diego Padres while under the influence of LSD.  Ellis won the game 2–0, receiving his support from two Willie Stargell home runs.
John "The Candy Man" Candelaria threw his no-hitter against the Los Angeles Dodgers on August 9, 1976, winning 2–0. Candelaria got out of a bases-loaded jam in the 3rd inning to preserve his no-hit shut out. It was the first no-hitter thrown in Pittsburgh by a Pirate since Nick Maddox in 1907.
July 12, 1997 was Pittsburgh's first non-Opening Day sellout since 1977; the crowd of 44,119 saw Francisco Córdova and Ricardo Rincón pitch 10 innings of no-hit, shut out baseball against the Houston Astros. The Pirates were held scoreless through nine innings, meaning the game would need extra innings. Rincon came in to relieve Córdova, who had thrown 121 pitches, in the 10th inning, and Rincón completed the performance by pitching a single inning of no-hit baseball. Rincon got the win when Mark Smith hit a three-run, pinch hit home run in the bottom of the 10th. Three seasons later, in 2000, Córdova was on his way to recording his 2nd no-hitter with the Pirates until he gave up a hit with one out in the 8th inning.
