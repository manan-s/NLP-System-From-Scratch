Pittsburgh sub-district schools
Prior to the establishment of the Pittsburgh Board of Public Education in 1911, each ward of the city (apart from the former Allegheny City which had its own school district) had one or more named sub-districts with the authority to levy taxes and build schools within its territory. The schools below were built under the sub-district system and taken over by the Board of Public Education in 1911.
Some sub-districts gave unique names to each school, while others used numbered schools (e.g. Colfax No. 1). The school board renamed all of the numbered schools in 1912.
