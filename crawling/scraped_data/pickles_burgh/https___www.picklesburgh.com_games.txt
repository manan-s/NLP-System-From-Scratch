Gherkin Games
This year, dare dill-vils from across the land competed for a shot at gherkin glory in three heart pounding events
Preliminary heats took take place on Friday, July 19 and Saturday, July 20, culminating in championships on Sunday, July 21. The winning champion of each event relished their victory with $500 in grand prize money, a life-like pickle trophy, and—most importantly—a “royal” title fitting of their pickle prowess.
Congrats to our 2024 Champions!
Pickle Juice Drinking
Quench your thirst for brine in this test of speed and fermented fortitude. Whoever can chug a quart (32 fl oz.) of
Pittsburgh Pickle Company’s Picklexir
the fastest will be deemed the winner of their round and vie for the title of
Duke of Drinking
in the championship on Sunday.
Pickle Eating –
New!
Only stomachs of steel will prevail in this new contest category! Whoever eats the most pickles by weight in five minutes (‘chipmunking’ is allowed) will win their round and earn a spot in the final, where the
Earl of Eating
, first of their name, will be crowned.
Bobbing for Pickles –
New!
No hands are allowed in this pickled take on the peculiar party pastime. Whoever can retrieve the most pickles by weight in 90 seconds using only their mouth will win the round and face-off in the finals to become Picklesburgh’s first
Baron of Bobbing
!
