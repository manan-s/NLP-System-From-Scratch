NEW! Introducing IC Pickle!
A Steel City staple,
Iron City Beer
is thrilled to debut its newest concoction:
IC Pickle!
A fermented first for Picklesburgh, this exclusive pickle-flavored edition of Iron City’s popular IC Light beer was developed in collaboration with
Pittsburgh Pickle Company
. “The crisp taste of cucumber balanced with fresh dill makes this lager most refreshing when spending the day trying the best pickles Pittsburgh has to offer,” said Brandon Mayes, director of brewing and quality assurance. IC Pickle will be exclusively on tap at Picklesburgh and is sure to be a hit among beer and brine enthusiasts alike.
Turner’s is once again putting a pickled twist on a non-alcoholic summertime classic!

! Turner’s ice-cold beverages are Pittsburgh’s favorite summer refreshment and will be offered as a special edition beverage along with classic iced teas and lemonades at multiple locations around the festival.
NEW! Jenny Lee is gearing up for Picklesburgh with a grilled cheese-and-gherkin sandwich!
World-famous for their swirl bread,

Their new signature sandwich is set to become an instant Picklesburgh classic, combining two buttered-up slices of their famous Garlic & Herb savory bread with Swiss cheese and pickles from Eerie-based Flippin’ Pickles. To give back to the community, Jenny Lee’s is also presenting free kids activities during Picklesburgh at the

area. Thanks to Jenny Lee’s, kids will be able to create pickle shaped jewelry and puppets in conjunction with creative staff from Arts Excursions Unlimited.
