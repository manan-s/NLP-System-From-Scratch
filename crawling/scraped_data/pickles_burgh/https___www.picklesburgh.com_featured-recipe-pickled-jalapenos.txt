Featured Recipe: Pickled Jalapeños
Pickled Jalapeños
From Emily Catalano of
GoodFoodPittsburgh.com
Great on tacos, nachos, on their own, and more.
1 lb. fresh jalapeños
1 cup cider vinegar
1 1/2 cups sugar
2 Tbsp. mustard seed
1/4 tsp. celery seed
1/4 tsp. turmeric
1 Tbsp. garlic powder
1/4 tsp. cayenne pepper
Slice jalapeños into 1/4 –inch pieces. Mix vinegar, sugar, turmeric, celery seed, mustard seed, garlic powder and cayenne in a saucepan. Bring mixture to boil over medium heat, and reduce for five to six minutes to simmer. Add jalapeños while the mixture is simmering, and allow to cook for five minutes. Use a strained spoon to add jalapenos to sterilized jars, and top with hot liquid. Process in a water bath for 15 minutes, or refrigerate.
