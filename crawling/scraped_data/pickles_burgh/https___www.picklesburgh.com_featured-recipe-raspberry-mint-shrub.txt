Featured Recipe: Raspberry Mint Shrub
Raspberry Mint Shrub
From Amber Webb of
Wigle Whiskey
A shrub is an excellent concentrate of flavor that has been re-popularized in recent years, dating back to the 1600s. Quite the trendy menu item, this tasty cocktail is great with your favorite alcohol or plain soda water and ice.
16 ounces raspberries
16 ounces granulated sugar
16 ounces apple cider vinegar
1 bunch of mint
1. In a medium bowl, combine the raspberries and sugar, using your hands to crush the raspberries until completely broken down. Cover and store in the refrigerator to macerate for at least 2 hours and up to 2 days.
2. Combine the thyme and vinegar in a small nonreactive bowl and store in a cool, dark place for at least 2 hours and up to 2 days.
3. Using a rubber spatula, press down on the raspberry mixture through a fine-mesh sieve into a medium bowl. Discard the solids. Strain the vinegar through the same sieve. Discard the mint
4. Pour the syrup and vinegar mixture into a Mason jar and store in the refrigerator for a week before serving. Serve the shrub with soda water or make a cocktail with gin and garnish with a lemon wedge.
