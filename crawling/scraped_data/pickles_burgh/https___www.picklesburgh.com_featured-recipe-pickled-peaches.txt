Featured Recipe: Pickled Peaches
Pickled Peaches
From Emily Catalano of
GoodFoodPittsburgh.com
Feel free to replace the peaches in this Pickled Peaches recipe with any other sweet fruit, as it works equally well with strawberries and raspberries.
1 1/2 cups white vinegar
1/4 cup honey
1/3 cup sugar
1/2 tsp. cinnamon
1-inch fresh ginger, peeled and cut into small cubes
2 pounds peaches, pitted and quartered
Combine white vinegar, honey, sugar, and cinnamon in a saucepan; put over medium heat and heat until the sugar dissolves (about two to three minutes). Do not allow the liquid to boil.
Add the ginger and the peaches to a 1-quart mason jar. Remove the liquid from the stove and pour the liquid over the peaches. Seal with a lid and place in the refrigerator. They will be ready to eat in one to two weeks.
