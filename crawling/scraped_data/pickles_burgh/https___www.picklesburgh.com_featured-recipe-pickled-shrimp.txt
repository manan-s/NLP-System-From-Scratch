Featured Recipe: Pickled Shrimp
P
ickled Shrimp
from Nicole from Two Acre Farms
This recipe is crazy simple. The shrimp are packed with perky, sharp flavors that add an excellent twist. You could eat this as a pre-dinner snack, but these shrimp would be marvelous in a simple green salad, or tossed with cold noodles.
– 2 tbsp. Old Bay seasoning
– 1 lb. (26-30 count) medium shrimp, peeled and deveined
– 1/2 tsp. celery seeds
– 1/4 tsp. allspice berries
– 1 cup extra-virgin olive oil
– 1/2 cup fresh lemon juice
– 1/4 cup packed flat-leaf parsley leaves, finely chopped
– 1 tbsp. Kosher salt
– 1/2 tsp. crushed red chili flakes
– 2 cloves garlic, finely chopped
– 12 dried bay leaves
– 1/2 medium yellow onion, thinly sliced lengthwise
Bring Old Bay and 8 cups water to a boil in a 4 quart saucepan, add shrimp, reduce heat to low, and cook until shrimp are pink (about 2 minutes).
Drain and transfer to bowl of ice water to chill, drain again.
Finely grind celery seeds and allspice in a spice grinder, transfer to a bowl, and stir in oil, juice, parsley, salt, chile flakes, garlic, and bay leaves in 1 qt. glass jar, layer shrimp and onions, pour over oil mixture. Cover with lid, chill overnight before serving.
