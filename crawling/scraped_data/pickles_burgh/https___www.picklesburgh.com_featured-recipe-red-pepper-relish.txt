Red Pepper Relish
From Vicki Abel
6 cups ½” cubes sweet red pepper
2 cups minced onion
8 minced garlic cloves
3-4 minced jalapeno peppers
3 tablespoons kosher salt
1 ¾-2 ¼ c sugar
1 ¾ c cider vinegar
1 tablespoon mustard seed
1 tablespoon oregano
1 bay leaf
Mix red pepper, onion, garlic, jalapenos and salt in a large bowl.  Let stand 3 hours. Drain thoroughly, do not rinse. Combine remaining ingredients in a large saucepan over medium high heat. Boil 10 minutes.  Reduce heat to medium, stir in drained pepper mixture and cook till peppers are translucent, but slightly crunchy, 30-45 minutes.
Pour into hot sterilized jars, filling to within ½ inch of the top. Run plastic knife between jar and relish to release any air bubbles.  Clean rim and threads with a damp cloth. Seal with scalded lid and ring,fingertip tight. Place in simmering water bath and process for 15 minutes.  Cool upside down on wire rack. Test for seal. Store in a dry place till ready to use. Makes 3 pints.
