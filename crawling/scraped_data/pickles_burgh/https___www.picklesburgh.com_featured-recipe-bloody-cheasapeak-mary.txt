Featured Recipe: Bloody Chesapeake Mary
Bloody Chesapeake Mary
From Nicole Olson of
Two Acre Farms
This drink is a snack and a cocktail all-in-one: nibble your way to the bottom of the glass. Serve the Bloody Chesapeake Mary with a selection of garnishes, including mini-hot pickles, garlic stuffed olives, and more. Store in the refrigerator for up to three days.
Old Bay Seasoning & lemons for rimming the glasses
3 cups high-quality tomato juice
3/4 tsp. Dried dill
3/4 tsp. White pepper
3/4 tsp. Celery seed
6 grinds smoked salt ( or 1/2 tsp. Salt)
12 dashes Worstershire sauce
12 dashes hot sauce (sriracha sauce)
3 ounces exlir ( we used 1 ounce hot pickle brine, 1 ounce blue cheese stuffed olives juice, 1 ounce garlic olive juice)
Juice of half lemon
4 tsp. Prepared horseradish
Garnishes
Sprinkle Old Bay Seasoning on plate. Rub glass with lemon wedge and dip rims of glass into Old Bay Seasoning.
Make mix: in a quart size mason jar, add the remaining ingredients except garnish.  Replace lid and shake.
Pour cocktail into rimmed glasses & garnish with celery (with leaf on top), lemon wedge and garnishes of your choice.
