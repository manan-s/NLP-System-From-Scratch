Featured Recipe: Pickled Stone Fruit and Mozzarella Naan
Pickled Stone Fruit and Mozzarella Naan
From Nicole Olson of
Two Acre Farms
A light vegetarian lunch, or even a savory summer dessert, the sugary pickling brine in this recipe helps the peaches and plums caramelize on the grill.
For the pickled fruit:
2 cups cider vinegar
1/4 cup sugar (fine)
1 tsp. Coriander seeds
1 tsp. Mustard seeds
1 tsp. Whole black Peppercorn
2 cloves garlic; crushed
2 sprigs thyme
1 sprig dill
2 peaches, pitted & cut into wedges
2 plums, pitted & cut into wedges
Other ingredients:
Garlic confit
6 Tbsp. Creme Fraiche
2 Tbsps. Shaved aged Gruyer (or Swiss)
2lbs. Buffalo Mozzarella cheese, cut into pieces
Baby arugula, for serving
Flake sea salt, and coarse black pepper
Balsamic Glaze
Naan Bread
Make the pickled fruit:
Bring vinegar, sugar, spices,  garlic, thymr, dill, and 1 cup water to a boil in a saucepan. Remove from heat and add fruit; let cool completely then strain, discarding liquid.  Cover and chill until ready to use.
