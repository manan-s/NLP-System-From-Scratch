Featured Recipe: Quick Pickled Strawberries
Q
uick Pickled Strawberries
from Marissa McClellan
– 1 dry quart strawberries {about 1 1/2 pounds or 680 grams}
– 3/4 cup or 180 ml Champagne vinegar
– 1 tablespoon granulated sugar
– 1 tablespoon finely milled sea salt
– 1 teaspoon cracked black peppercorns
– 2 sprigs tarragon
Wash the strawberries, remove the stems and leaves, and cut into halves or quarters, depending on size.
In a medium saucepan, combine the vinegar with 1/3 cup / 80ml water, the sugar, salt and peppercorns. Set over high heat and bring to a boil.
Place the tarragon in a wide-mouth 1-quart/1-liter jar and add the chopped berries. Once the brine has boiled pour it over the strawberries. Let the pickles cool until room temperature, and then place a lid on the jar and refrigerate.
Allow the pickles to rest for at least 24 hours before eating.
