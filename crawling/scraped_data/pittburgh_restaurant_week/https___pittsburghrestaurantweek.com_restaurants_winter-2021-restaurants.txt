Pittsburgh Restaurant Week Winter 2021 • January 11-17
Some locations extended to January 24 • Takeout Available • Theme: “New Dishes for the New Year”
Participating restaurants are committed to operating within all local, state and federal health and safety guidelines which include necessary occupancy restrictions.
Guests should plan on wearing face coverings upon arrival, while being seated and anytime moving about the restaurant.
Many restaurants are “doubling down” by extending their usual week-long special menus an extra week to make them available to additional patrons this season and still abide by occupancy restrictions.
