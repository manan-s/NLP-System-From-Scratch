Restaurant Week Tips
MAKE RESERVATIONS.
Most locations accept reservations during restaurant week to streamline their customer service. For restaurants that do not offer online reservations, call to inquire about a dining time.
MENTION RESTAURANT WEEK.
When being seated and offered menus, ensure to mention Pittsburgh Restaurant Week to the waitstaff to ensure you are getting the correct menus and pricing.
GRATUITIES APPRECIATED.
Waitstaff handle a surge of customers during restaurant week and many of the special menus are multiple courses that would have been priced higher if ordered a la carte. If you are able, consider gratuities that take into account the original pricing and extra effort to perfect a multi-course service.
