Step 2: Submit Menu
Each restaurant is expected to create a limited-time, small menu that is offered for dine-in guests between the dates of the celebration. Ideally, this special menu is in addition to the restaurant’s normal menu. While many restaurants opt for a multi-course menu with multiple options per course, that is not the designated requirement.
A multi-course meal – OR – Specialty Dishes priced for the Year
Dinner is the “required” course, but lunch and brunch special menus are also permitted in addition to the dine-in dinner.
View Past Restaurant Week Profile Pages
After completing the step of submitting the menu, the menu will be formatted and published on your restaurant profile for the season.
Please DO NOT upload the menu formatted as an image. This will increase the processing time to get it listed onto the site. The graphical menus pictured above will be formatted by PRW and posted on PRW social channels.
