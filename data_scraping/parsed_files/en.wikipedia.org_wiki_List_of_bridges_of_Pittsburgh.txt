bridges are visible in this aerial photo The bridges of Pittsburgh play an important role in the citys transportation system  Without bridges  the Pittsburgh region would be a series of fragmented valleys hillsides river plains and isolated communities  1  A 2006 study  2  determined that at the time Pittsburgh had 446 bridges though that number has been disputed  3  With its proximity to three major rivers and countless hills and ravines  Pittsburgh is known as The City of Bridges   4  History  edit  Pittsburghs first river bridges made of wood and long since replaced opened in 1818 at Smithfield Street and 1819 at Sixth Street then St Clair Street The citys oldest inservice bridge is the current Smithfield Street Bridge  which opened in 1883 it was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1976  5  Pittsburgh waged a massive road and bridge building campaign from 1924 to 1940 most of Pittsburghs oldest major bridges date from this period The coming of the Interstate Highway System triggered more construction in the second half of the twentieth century as vehicular speed and throughput requirements increased The result of more than 100 years of bridge building is a collection of most of the major types of bridge  suspension  cantilever  arch  etc mostly built from locally produced steel  including about forty river spans Many of the bridges in the Downtown area are colored Aztec Gold  6  either constructed as such or painted afterward to match the citys official colors of black and gold A few old and outofservice bridges such as the Hot Metal Bridge which stood dormant until reopening as a passenger bridge in the year 2000 are exceptions to this rule Degrading bridge conditions  edit  According to a 2011 study by Transportation for America  1194 bridges in the Pittsburgh areaor 304were deficient the highest proportion in the nation  7   8  On February 8 2008 the Birmingham Bridge suffered a failure of its rocker bearings causing the deck to drop eight inches prompting a closure of the bridge The bridge was repaired and fully reopened on September 8 2008  9  On January 28 2022 the Fern Hollow Bridge across Frick Park collapsed forcing the closure of Forbes Avenue through the park The bridge was covered with snow when it collapsed at 639 am local time as it was being crossed by several cars and a bus  10  The bridge was rebuilt and reopened on December 22 2022  11  Major bridges  edit  This table lists all bridges crossing the Allegheny  Monongahela and Ohio rivers in the City of Pittsburgh limits Other large or notable bridges
