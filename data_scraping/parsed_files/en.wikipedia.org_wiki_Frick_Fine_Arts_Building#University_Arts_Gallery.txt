18881984 daughter of the Pittsburgh industrialist and art patron Henry Clay Frick 18491919 She established the Fine Arts Department at the University of Pittsburgh in 1926 and continued to fund it through the 1950s when she first made a commitment to create a separate structure to house it  5  Land for the project was donated to the university by the City of Pittsburgh In early negotiations with the University of Pittsburgh Miss Frick asked that successors to the New York architects Carr√®re and Hastings design the new facility after the Italian palazzo its firm had built in Manhattan for her father some fifty years earlier Eventually however both parties agreed to Burton Kenneth Johnstone Associates as the architects Its design is modeled after Pope Julius III s 14871555 Villa Giulia in Rome Italy  The building is constructed of white limestone and marble with a terracotta tile roof around a central courtyard An octagonal cupola which caps the central rotunda rises 45 feet above the ground  5  The building houses the University of Pittsburghs Department of History of Art and Architecture and Department of Studio Arts and contains classrooms an open cloister an art gallery a 200seat auditorium as well as a research library Construction began in 1962 and the building was opened in May 1965 By the late 1960s Miss Frick unhappy that the university did not conform to her restrictions on management of both the department and the new building severed her ties with the University of Pittsburgh She responded by creating a new venture The Frick Art Museum  on the property of her ancestral home Clayton a few miles east in Pittsburghs Point Breeze neighborhood That museum operates today as a part of the Frick Art  Historical Center complex Building use and features  edit  The Nicholas Lochoff Cloister of Frick Fine Arts Building Today the Frick Fine Arts Building consists of classrooms art studios a library and art galleries around an open cloister and

was 79 years old when she accepted the commission She could not sculpt it herself because union rules prevented sculptors from working on a relief attached to a building However she climbed up on the scaffolding to oversee the completion of the work  7   8  Inside the main entrance a neon work by contemporary Chinese artist Gu Wenda is installed in the lobby  9  The building also contains a 200seat auditorium that is used for lectures performances and special events  10  Nicholas Lochoff Cloister  edit  The Frick Fine Arts Library The Nicholas Lochoff Cloister is a main feature of the

Lochoffs death with the help of art critic Bernard Berenson  In 2003 the paintings were cleaned and restored by Christine Daulton Also in the gallery are noted Carrara marble reproductions of 14th
