Jun 1970 John Candelaria 90 9 Aug 1976 Francisco Córdova Ricardo Rincón 90 10 12 Jul 1997 On September 20 1907  Nick Maddox  a 20yearold rookie  4  threw the first nohitter for the Pittsburgh Pirates baseball club Through 1907 and 1908 Maddox won 20 of his 30 starts making him the fastest pitcher to ever reach 20 games This mark will be tied in the future by three other pitchers but never beaten Maddox won the third game of the 1909 World Series over Detroit  but was released in 1910 after winning only two games The Pirates waited decades later for their next nohitter which was delivered by Cliff Chambers against the Boston Braves in Boston a 30 victory on May 6 1951  Chambers walked eight and had one wild pitch  and he also drove in the third run in the 8th inning For Chambers this was his last victory in a Pirates uniform Bob Moose nohit the New York Mets in New York on September 20 1969  which became the 5th nohitter recorded by National League pitchers a record at the time Moose later moved into a relief role and in 1976 led the Pirates in saves Dock Ellis might be considered the most notorious nohitter pitcher In his autobiography Dock Ellis in the Country of Baseball  Ellis revealed that he pitched his nohitter against the San Diego Padres while under the influence of LSD  Ellis won the game 20 receiving his support from two Willie Stargell home runs John The Candy Man Candelaria threw his nohitter against the Los Angeles Dodgers on August 9 1976 winning 20  5  Candelaria got out of a basesloaded jam in the 3rd inning to preserve his nohit shut out It was the first nohitter thrown in Pittsburgh by a Pirate since Nick Maddox in 1907  6  July 12 1997 was Pittsburghs first nonOpening Day sellout since 1977  the crowd of 44119 saw Francisco Córdova and Ricardo Rincón pitch 10 innings of nohit shut out baseball against the Houston Astros   7  The Pirates were held scoreless through nine innings meaning the game would need extra innings  Rincon came in to relieve Córdova who had thrown 121 pitches in the 10th inning and Rincón completed the performance by pitching a single inning of nohit baseball Rincon got the win when Mark Smith hit a threerun pinch hit home run in the bottom of the 10th Three seasons later in 2000  Córdova was on his way to recording his 2nd nohitter with the Pirates until he gave up a hit with one out in the 8th inning League
