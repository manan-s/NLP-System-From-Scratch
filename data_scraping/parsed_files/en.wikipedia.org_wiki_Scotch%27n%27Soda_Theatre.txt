501c3 Location Carnegie Mellon University Origins The White Friars Club Area served Pittsburgh Key people Board Of Directors Website ScotchnSoda Theatre ScotchnSoda is a studentrun theatre organization that resides on the campus of Carnegie Mellon University  Its initial dedication was the creation and production of original musicals but has now taken to performing both professionally published and studentwritten materials Students are welcome to write compose design direct perform in and otherwise become involved with every aspect of each production The organization is open to all Carnegie Mellon students from all backgrounds who are interested and all performances are public with varying ticket prices History  edit  ScotchnSoda Theatre is the nations oldest coed student theater group and is one of the oldest and largest student organizations at Carnegie Mellon University  It was founded in the fall of 1907 as The White Friars Club providing a theatrical outlet for the students of the Carnegie Technical Schools  Their first production in the spring of 1908 was entitled All in a Dormitory and gave a comical look at life on campus The club would grow in only three years to have a membership of seventyeight in 1910 and continued on to have its first financially successful year in 1911  1   2  The White Friars Club was shortlived as student theater went on hiatus during World War I  It wasnt until 1932 when a student theater group called The Bacchanalians formed to produce a musical for Carnegie Techs Spring Carnival   3  The organization took its current name in 1937 during a vote by the membership Unconfirmed rumor has it that the name with the most votes was HopnScotch but the leaders of the organization fixed the vote so that ScotchnSoda came out victorious In any case the newly named studentrun theater troupe founded by three drama majors began producing original fulllength musicals for Spring Carnival With the exception of a fiveyear break from 1942 to 1946 for World War II  ScotchnSoda has been producing musicals for Carnival continuously to the present In the 1960s ScotchnSoda began expanding its season by producing shows for Homecoming While then still heavily populated by drama majors SnS provided a theatrical outlet to students of all disciplines and encouraged collaboration on original works Certainly the most notable of these original works from the 60s was the musical Pippin Pippin by drama student Stephen Schwartz  produced for Carnival 1967 This show was produced on Broadway just five years later in 1972 under the shortened title Pippin and was directed and choreographed by the famed Bob Fosse   4   5  ScotchnSoda continued to grow in the 1970s winning a Broadcast Music Inc award for Outstanding Variety Show in 1970 for Something Personal by David Sheridan Spangler and Mark Pirolo and again in 1972 and 1973 for A New Day and Lord Have Mercy both by Stephen M Fechtor  6   7  However in a major blow to the membership the School of Drama forbade acting majors from participating in ScotchnSoda productions in 1976 Despite losing the core of the membership the remaining members of the club decided to press on with completely studentrun nonmajor theater Not satisfied with only doing musicals for Homecoming and Carnival ScotchnSoda introduced the campus first longform improvisational comedy production in 1988 This began a 20year period of growth and change for the organization In the early 1990s they expanded to a threeproduction season In 1993 a subsidiary group that existed for one year called Club Soda formed which taught new skills to the diverse membership This led to more submissions of both student and professionally written plays and in 1994 the theater company began regular theater seasons of three shows plus the Spring Carnival Musical In 1996 another subsidiary troupe formed The No Parking Players  Carnegie Mellons first improv comedy group In 1998 ScotchnSoda expanded to a permanent fiveproduction season Today ScotchnSoda proudly produces six to seven shows each season ranging from fullscale musicals to intimate black box plays performing in a variety of spaces in the University Center and elsewhere on campus With a strongly committed and talented membership spanning all six of Carnegie Mellons undergraduate colleges and representing over 30 different majors ScotchnSoda is growing still and is well poised to continue providing studentrun theater to the Carnegie Mellon campus community for years to come Board of directors  edit  ScotchnSoda is governed by a board of nine directors 1  Each position of the board is elected annually by the general membership These positions along with the students who currently occupy them include President Lucia Shen Artistic Director Levi ChaplinLoebell Vice President Ellie Burckhardt Managing Director Sophie Vincens Technical Coordinator  TBD  Public Relations Coordinator  TBD  Secretary Flannery McNair General Membership Coordinator Riley Zhao Executive Board Member Martin Baker These nine students work to contribute and act as executive producers to each production They also hold open weekly meetings to discuss all issues related to the organization and hold responsibility for selecting material for productions They are assisted by auxiliary board members who handle various facets of the organization and include the Webmaster Historian Director of Alumni Relations Directors of Technical Production and Artistic Training Music Liaison and various liaisons to the subsidiary troupes within the organization All auxiliary board members are represented at Board Meetings by the Vice President Show process  edit  Selection of material  edit  ScotchnSoda welcomes scripts presented from any student on Carnegie Mellons campus though it does not have to be studentwritten Playwrights who are not Carnegie Mellon students may submit their own material as long as it is submitted through a current CMU student All scripts must be approved by the board who examine each script and approve those that appeal to the community and membership and are technically feasible After scripts are approved all Carnegie Mellon students are welcome to submit a Directors Proposal to the ScotchnSoda board In a publicly held meeting directors present their proposals to the board The meeting is then closed to the public as the board selects a specific show for production Several weeks into production a Board Preview performance is heldwhich includes an open rehearsal of the show as well as reports from all members of the technical staff on the production It is at this Board Preview that final approval must be given to a show before it may begin performances Funding  edit  ScotchnSoda is funded by a specific allocation of a student activities fee paid by all students and distributed by Carnegie Mellons Joint Funding Committee ScotchnSoda does not profit from its productions nor does any member receive payment for services  8   9  Venues  edit  Originally ScotchnSoda presented all its performances in Pittsburghs Carnegie Music Hall  located less than one mile from the schools campus Eventually due to rental fees and time commitments ScotchnSoda had to leave the large performance hall and was transplanted into the Carnegie Mellon gym This was soon followed by a move into a specially constructed stage in Skibo Ballroom part of the Skibo University Center on Carnegie Mellons campus In the summer of 1994 this building was torn down to make room for the schools current University Center During the two years of construction ScotchnSoda was completely homeless and performed in various lecture halls the drill deck of the old student center and off campus at Rodef Shalom Congregation  Upon the completion of CMUs University Center ScotchnSoda has been alternating performance spaces throughout the building including The Connan Room The McKennaPeterWright Room Rangos Ballroom and McConomy Auditorium This has proven difficult for the organization to this day as access to the performance spaces is very limited and in most cases they can only use each performance space for a maximum of seven consecutive days Spring Carnival performances in 199799 were able to reserve Rangos hall for two weeks This limited amount of time includes loadin rehearsals performances and strike In fact unable to find a suitable venue the May 2001 production of Edward Albees The Zoo Story was performed outside in the Highlander Compass Some other venues have been used in recent years including Porter Hall 100 Porter Hall 125C and the Helen Wayne Rauh Studio Theatre in the Purnell Center As of Fall 2016 most performances are held in the Cohon University Center Studio Theater a black box theater constructed as part of the University Center expansion and opened in 2016  10  Subtroupes  edit  The No Parking Players  edit  No Parking Players Improv Founded in
