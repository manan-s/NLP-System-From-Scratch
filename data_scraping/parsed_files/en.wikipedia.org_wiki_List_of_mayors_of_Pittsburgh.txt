executive of the government of the city of Pittsburgh  Pennsylvania  United States  as stipulated by the Charter of the City of Pittsburgh  2  Prior to the 1816 city charter the Borough of Pittsburgh had its council elect a chief burgess among themselves After the borough was rechartered as a city its first seven mayors were selected in a similar fashion as the chief burgesses had been under borough council It was not until Mayor Samuel Pettigrew in the 1830s that general elections of popular vote were conducted among all the citys voters to determine who would hold the mayors office Pettigrew was both the last mayor selected by council and the first generally elected mayor of Pittsburgh From 1901 to 1903 the state legislature took control of the city on the grounds of corruption by former Mayor William J Diehl with the passage of the socalled ripper bill and appointed the unelected recorders Joseph Brown and Adam Brown who were answerable only to the state government Since 1903 all mayors have been popularly elected The mayor as of January 2022 update is Democrat Ed Gainey  Chief burgesses 17941813  edit  No Chief Burgess Term Party Notes 1 George Robinson 1794c 1800
