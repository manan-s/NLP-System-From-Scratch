History  edit  Prior to 1998 the JCC of Greater Pittsburgh had a small community gallery for nearly 25 years Under the auspices of Leslie A Golomb Archived 20100514 at the Wayback Machine  the gallery underwent a period of substantial growth evolving into a museum and receiving accreditation from the Council of American Jewish Museums CAJM  2  Accreditation by CAJM requires strict adherence to standards regarding archives catalogues and curating as well as educational programs and outreach Today the AJM galleries are still located on the Pittsburgh JCCs Squirrel Hill campus While the AJM continues to emphasize the Pittsburgh community in its exhibitions and programming its scope has grown as it collaborates with regional national and international artists and organizations Additionally the AJM frequently explores Jewish themes such as contemporary iterations of rituals but aims to reach the wider community though exhibits with broad appeal and programming that encourages interfaith discourse Recent exhibitions  edit  As a noncollecting museum the AJM works with local national and international artists to create original exhibitions  3  and occasionally
