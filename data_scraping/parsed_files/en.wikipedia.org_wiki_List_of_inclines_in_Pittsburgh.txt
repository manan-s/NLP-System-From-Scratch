19th century Following road building and greater use of private automobiles the inclines business declined and most were closed and removed The Monongahela Incline  the first built in the city and the Duquesne Incline are the only two still operating They carry passengers between Mount Washington and the lowlands along the Monongahela River  They are each listed on the National Register of Historic
