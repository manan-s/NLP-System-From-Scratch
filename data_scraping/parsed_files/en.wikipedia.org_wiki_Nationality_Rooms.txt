The Nationality Rooms are a group of 31 classrooms in the University of Pittsburghs Cathedral of Learning depicting and donated by the national and ethnic groups that helped build the city of Pittsburgh  The rooms are designated as a Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation historical landmark and are located on the 1st and 3rd floors of the Cathedral of Learning itself a national historic landmark  4   5  on the University of Pittsburgh s main campus in the Oakland neighborhood of Pittsburgh Pennsylvania  United States Although of museum caliber 29 of the 31 rooms are used as daily classrooms by University of Pittsburgh faculty and students while the other two the Early American and SyrianLebanon are display rooms viewed through glass doors utilized primarily for special events and can only be explored via special guided tour The Nationality Rooms also serve in a vigorous program of intercultural involvement and exchange in which the original organizing committees for the rooms remain as participants and which includes a program of annual student scholarship to facilitate study abroad  6  In addition the Nationality Rooms inspire lectures seminars concerts exhibitions and social events which focus on the various heritages and traditions of the nations represented The national traditional and religious holidays of the nations represented are celebrated on campus and the rooms are appropriately decorated to reflect these occasions The Nationality Rooms are available daily for public tours as long as the particular room is not being used for a class or other university function  7  History  edit  The Nationality Room Program was founded by Ruth Crawford Mitchell at the request of Pitt Chancellor John Bowman in 1926 in order to involve the community in constructing the Cathedral of Learning and to provide the spiritual and symbolic foundation of the Cathedral that would make the inside of the building as inspiring and impressive as the outside Under Mitchells direction invitations were extended to national communities in the Pittsburgh area to sponsor a room that was representative of their heritage Each group formed a Room Committee responsible for fundraising designing and acquisition The university provided the room and upkeep in perpetuity once completed while all other materials labor and design were provided by the individual committees These were sometimes partly provided for by foreign governments which responded with generous support often providing architects artists materials and monetary gifts to assure authenticity and superb quality in their classrooms  8  Each room is carefully designed and executed down to the switch plates door handles hinges and wastebaskets The work is often performed and designed by native artists and craftsmen and involves imported artifacts and materials Mitchell remained Director of the Nationality Rooms program until 1956 having overseen the creation of the first 19 rooms on the first floor of the cathedral A successor to Mitchell wasnt named until 1965 when E Maxine Bruhns took over the program overseeing the completion of twelve additional rooms on the third floor Bruhns retired on Jan 1 2020 after 54 years in the position and died in July 2020  9   10  The Nationality Rooms Information tours and gift shop center just off the Commons Room A typical room on the 1st floor built between 1938 and 1957 took between three and ten years to complete and would have cost the equivalent of 453417 today which was no small undertaking especially considering that the fundraising and construction of the initial rooms took place during the Great Depression and World War II  More recent rooms have cost in the range of US750000 and up and took up to ten years to complete  11  Upon completion of their rooms the committees turn to a program of intercultural exchange and fundraising for nationality rooms scholarships which enable University of Pittsburgh students and faculty to study abroad The room committees also sponsor cultural and fundraising events lectures concerts exhibits social events and workshops on ethnic studies that may utilize the rooms The committee may use its room for nonpolitical meetings lectures or other functions if no classes are scheduled Distinguished international visitors are received by the committees and special projects are undertaken including the purchase of books for the University libraries  publication of volumes on topics from comparative literature to ethnic recipes and the fostering of courses in the mother languages National traditional and religious holidays are celebrated on campus and committees decorate their rooms or mount displays to commemorate special occasions The first four rooms to be dedicated were the Scottish  Russian  German  and Swedish Rooms in 1938  12  The newest rooms are the Turkish and Swiss rooms both dedicated in 2012  13   14  the Korean room dedicated in 2015  15  and the Philippine Room dedicated in 2019  16  Original plans also proposed in addition to the Nationality Rooms on the first floor the creation of  Pennsylvania  classrooms on the second floor to be dedicated to the pioneering groups within the state along with third floor Pittsburgh classrooms dedicated to showcasing the history of the Western Pennsylvania or different eras of American history  17   18  Although the plans for the series of rooms were drawn up only one room was installed the Early American Classroom which is now counted among the other Nationality Rooms The plans for the other Pittsburgh and Pennsylvania rooms were never executed and the Nationality Room program grew to occupy all of the first and much of the third floor The English Classroom the largest of the 31 Nationality Rooms contains several artifacts from the original second House of Commons Upon completion of a room a dedication ceremony is held with a formal presentation of a ceremonial key to the universitys Chancellor to symbolize the bestowal and acceptance of the gift and a commitment by the university to maintain the room in perpetuity The nationality room committee officers then become members of the Nationality Council which provides scholarships for summer study abroad for Pitt students along with other nonpolitical cultural or educational events within the Nationality Programs scope Today  as of  the cathedral is home to 31 Nationality Rooms 29 working classrooms and two display rooms the Early American Room and the SyrianLebanon Room on the first and third floors Each nationality room celebrates a different culture that influenced Pittsburghs growth depicting an era prior to 1787 the universitys founding and the signing of the United States Constitution  Only one room does not follow this convention with the French Classroom depicting the First French Empire of the early 19th century There are two additional rooms in the process of being approved and funded

go  that guides over 40000 tourists a year With reservations specially themed tours based on creature symbolism images of royalty and folktales are also given An estimated 100000 visitors including selfguided and walkin tourists visit the Nationality Rooms each year Principles  edit  The Indian Classroom opened in 2000 is one of the newer Nationality Rooms that continue to be installed on the third floor The following principles in order to assure commonality of purpose authenticity and nonpolitical cultural emphasis governed the creation of nationality rooms from the programs inception in 1926 until the completion of the Irish Classroom in 1957 A Nationality Room must illustrate one of the outstanding architectural or design traditions of a nation that is recognized as such by the United States Department of State  The design of a given historical period must be cultural and aesthetic not political The period depicted should be prior to 1787 the year the university was founded To avoid political implications in the room no political symbol is permitted in the decorations nor a portrait or likeness of any living person The only place a political symbol may be used is in the corridor stone above the rooms entrance No donor recognition may appear in the rooms Donor recognition to the rooms is recorded in a Donor Book Most architects and designers of the rooms have been born and educated abroad This has been instrumental in ensuring authenticity of design In the 1970s policy revisions were implemented which retaining most of the earlier principles utilized a broader definition of nation to include a body of people associated with a particular territory and possessing a distinctive cultural and social way of life This allowed the creation of the Armenian and Ukrainian rooms prior to their establishment as independent nations following the collapse of the Soviet Union  as well as allowing for the installation of the African Heritage Room The room must also be a functional teaching classroom with enough student tabletarmed seats professors lectern or table adequate sight lines and lighting modern audiovisual technology and other necessities of a

farm village on the outskirts of Kyoto and the design represents the core rooms of the house a plankfloored ima or household sitting room and the adjacent doma an area with a compacted earthen floor used as an entryway for cooking and as a work space The doma was also a space for household life where farm business and craft activities could be carried out under a roof In the past it also provided a place for drying grain during rainy weather A central feature of the room is the massive roughhewn beam the ushibari of Japanese pine  supported by posts at the boundary of the ima and doma elements of the room The main beam in this room had been carefully preserved by the carpenters in Japan for many years until a project could be found to appropriately utilize its unique curvature To accommodate the weight concentrated on the primary post the daikokubashira the layout of the room has been designed so that this main post sits directly above the buildings existing superstructure The major posts are made of zelkova   keyaki  a hardwood with a distinctive grain pattern The other beams are made of American pine The posts and beams are connected without nails using traditional joinery techniques The ceiling is of bamboo with joined beams which would have allowed for the circulation of warm air from fireplaces below The walls mimics the typical mud plaster walls through the use of textured wallpaper and wooden wainscoting for greater durability The bay window is a structure not in keeping with traditional Japanese design and has been masked with panels that suggest shôji sliding doors of lattice frames covered with translucent paper The ima is suggested with a plank wood floor covering the largest portion of the room The floor toward the front of the room is made of a simulated earthen material to represent a portion of the doma where it meets the imas wooden floor Although the traditional design would call for the wooden floor to be much higher than the dirt floor
