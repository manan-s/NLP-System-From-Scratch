Presbyterian graduate seminary in Pittsburgh  Pennsylvania  Founded in 1794 it houses one of the largest theological libraries in the tristate area  History  edit  Pittsburgh Theological Seminary was formed in 1959 by consolidating the Presbyterian Church in the USA s Western Theological Seminary and the United Presbyterian Church of North America s PittsburghXenia Theological Seminary  The

the founding of Service Seminary Associate Theological Seminary in the town of Service Beaver County Pennsylvania  in 1792 by the Associate Presbytery of Pennsylvania Prior to that time the Presbytery

several times from Service to Canonsburg Pennsylvania  then to Xenia Ohio  where it became Xenia Theological Seminary  This occurred in the 1850s and was prompted by a desire to locate nearer to the growing population in the Midwest  Joseph Kyle joined the faculty in 1900 leaving 4th United Presbyterian Church in Allegheny Pennsylvania  In approximately 1914 Kyle was appointed president In 1920 the trustees determined to move the seminary to St Louis Missouri  also to be nearer to potential students in the Plains states In 1921 Kyle died unexpectedly This loss of leadership at a crucial transition period created problems for the fledgling institution and it never really took root In 1930 Xenia merged with a seminary that was founded in Pittsburgh in 1825 which was known as Pittsburgh Seminary 18251833 19131930 and Allegheny Seminary 18331912  1  Together Pittsburgh and Xenia formed the PittsburghXenia Theological Seminary This institution was later augmented by the resources of

establishment of classical academies in Washington Pennsylvania  the first in 1785 by Joseph Smith and another in 1787 by John McMillan Out of these academies the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church USA created Western Seminary It was indeed a western seminary in 1825 furnishing a ministry for the rapidly opening frontier territories along the Ohio River  2  Since the 1959 consolidation
