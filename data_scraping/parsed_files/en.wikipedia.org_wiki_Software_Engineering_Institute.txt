Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering Operating agency Carnegie Mellon University Website seicmuedu Map Location in Pittsburgh Software Engineering Institute  SEI  is a federally funded research and development center in Pittsburgh  Pennsylvania  United States Founded in 1984 the institute is now sponsored by the United States Department of Defense and the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering  and administrated by Carnegie Mellon University   1   2  The activities of the institute cover cybersecurity  software assurance  software engineering and acquisition and component capabilities critical to the United States Department of Defense Authority  edit  The Carnegie Mellon Software Engineering Institute is a federally funded research and development center headquartered on the campus of Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh  Pennsylvania  United States  The SEI also has offices in Washington DC  Arlington County Virginia  and Los Angeles  California The SEI operates with major funding from the US Department of Defense  The SEI also works with industry and academia through research collaborations  1  On November 14 1984 the US Department of Defense elected Carnegie Mellon University as the host site of the Software Engineering Institute  1  The institute was founded with an initial allocation of 6 million with another 97 million to be allocated in the subsequent five years The SEIs contract with the Department of Defense is subject to review and renewal every five years SEI focuses on several technical directions software engineering  cybersecurity  assurance  and DoD critical component capabilities   3  Areas of work  edit  The SEI defines specific initiatives aimed at improving organizations software engineering capabilities Management practices  edit  Organizations need to effectively manage the acquisition development and evolution ADE of softwareintensive systems Success in software engineering management practices helps organizations predict and control quality schedule cost cycle time and productivity The bestknown example of SEI in management practices is the SEIs Capability Maturity Model CMM for Software now Capability Maturity Model Integration CMMI  The CMMI approach consists of models appraisal methods and training courses that have been proven to improve process performance In 2006 Version 12 of the CMMI Product Suite included the release of CMMI for Development CMMI for Development was the first of three constellations defined in Version 12 the others include CMMI for Acquisition and CMMI for Services The CMMI for Services constellation was released in February 2009 Another management practice developed by CERT which is part of the SEI is the Resilience Management Model CERTRMM The CERTRMM is a capability model for operational resilience management Version 10 of the Resilience Management Model was released in May 2010 Engineering practices  edit  SEI work in engineering practices increases the ability of software engineers to analyze predict and control selected functional and nonfunctional properties of software systems Key SEI tools and methods include the SEI Architecture Tradeoff Analysis Method ATAM method the SEI Framework for Software Product Line Practice and the SEI Service Migration and Reuse Technique SMART Security  edit  The SEI is also the home of the CERTCC CERT Coordination Center a federally funded computer security organization The SEI CERT Programs primary goals are to ensure that appropriate technology and systemsmanagement practices are used to resist attacks on networked systems and to limit damage and ensure continuity of critical services in spite of successful attacks accidents or failures The SEI CERT program is working with USCERT to produce the Build Security In BSI website which provides guidelines for building security into every phase of the software development lifecycle  The SEI has also conducted research on insider threats and computer forensics  Results of this research and other information now populate the CERT Virtual Training Environment Special programs  edit  SEI Partner Network  edit  The SEI Partner Network helps the SEI disseminate software engineering best practices Organizations and individuals in the SEI Partner Network are selected trained and licensed by the SEI to deliver authentic SEI services which include courses consulting methods and management processes The network currently consists of nearly 250 partner organizations worldwide Conferences  edit  The SEI sponsors national and international conferences workshops and usergroup meetings Other events cover subjects including the acquisition of softwareintensive systems commercial offtheshelf COTSbased systems network security and survivability software process research software product lines  CMMI and the SEI Team Software Process Education and training  edit  Main facility on Fifth Avenue in Pittsburgh SEI courses are currently offered at the SEIs locations in the United States and Europe In addition using licensed course materials SEI Partners train individuals Membership program  edit  The SEI Membership Program helps the software engineering community to network SEI Members include small business owners software and systems programmers CEOs directors and managers from both Fortune 500 companies and government organizations  4  Affiliate program  edit  Through the SEI Affiliate Program organizations place technical experts with the SEI for periods ranging from 12 months to four years Affiliates currently are working on projects with the SEI to identify develop and demonstrate improved software engineering practices Software Process Achievement award program  edit  In order to recognize outstanding achievements in improving an organizations ability to create and evolve softwaredependent systems the SEI and IEEE Computer Society created the Software Process Achievement Award program  5  In addition to rewarding excellence the purpose of this award is to foster continuous advancement in the practice of software engineering and to disseminate insights experiences and proven practices throughout the relevant research and practitioner communities Research and publications  edit  The SEI publishes reports that offer new technical information about software engineering topics whether theoretical or applied The SEI also publishes books on software engineering for industry government and military applications and practices In addition the SEI offers public courses workshops and conferences in process improvement software architecture and product lines and security Controversies  edit  Further information CERT

Engineering Institute of aiding the Federal Bureau of Investigation in uncovering the identities of users of the Tor network  Later prosecution showed the hack was paid for by the Department of Defense and subpoenaed by the FBI  7  Focus of progressive protests  edit  SEI has been an occasional site of antiwar movement and peace movement protests  8   9   10  many of which have been organized by Pittsburghs Thomas Merton Center  Popular culture  edit  The tunnel in SEI served as the entrance to Blackgate Prison in The Dark Knight Rises SEI served as the Blackgate Prison in the 2012 film The Dark Knight Rises  See also  edit  Engineering portal Software engineer Personal software process PSP Team software process TSP References  edit   a b c Linda Hutz Pesante January 1 2003
