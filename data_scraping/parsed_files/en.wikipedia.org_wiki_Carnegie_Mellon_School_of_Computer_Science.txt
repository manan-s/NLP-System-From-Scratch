free encyclopedia School for computer science in the United States SCS at Carnegie Mellon The School of Computer Science  SCS  at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh  Pennsylvania US is a school for computer science established in 1988 It has been consistently ranked among the best computer science programs over the decades As of 2024 US News  World Report ranks the graduate program as tied for No 1 with Massachusetts Institute of Technology  Stanford University and University of California Berkeley   1  The GatesHillman Complex home to Carnegie Mellon Universitys School of Computer Science Researchers from Carnegie Mellon School of Computer Science have made fundamental contributions to the fields of algorithms  artificial intelligence  computer networks  distributed systems  parallel processing  programming languages  computational biology  robotics  language technologies  humancomputer interaction and software engineering  History  edit  In July 1965 Allen Newell  Herbert A Simon  and Alan J Perlis  in conjunction with the faculty from the Graduate School of Industrial Administration GSIA renamed Tepper School of Business in 2004 staff from the newly formed Computation Center and key administrators created the Computer Science Department one of the first such departments in the nation Their mission statement was to cultivate a course of study leading to the PhD degree in computer science  a program that would exploit the new technology and assist in establishing a discipline of computer science  The educational program formally accepted in October 1965 drew its first graduate students from several existing academic disciplines mathematics electrical engineering  psychology  and the interdisciplinary Systems and Communications Sciences program in the Graduate School of Industrial Administration  The department was housed within the Mellon College of Science  With support from Newell Simon Nico Haberman  Provost Angel Jordan and President Richard Cyert  the computer science department began a twoyear status as a floating department in the early months of 1986 Then the Department began to grow both academically and financially In 1988 the School of Computer Science was established among the first such schools in the country The Computer Science Department was the original department within the school  2  Structure in the 1970s  edit  During the 1970s the Computer Science Department offered only a PhD study program with no masters degree as an intermediate step The PhD program required a minimum of six years of residency It was called the do or die program among the graduate students because a student could not drop a PhD and receive a masters degree It had quickly focused on computer networking operating systems  Hydra  Accent  Mach  and robotics  SCS today  edit  Organizational units  edit  Ray and Stephanie Lane Computational Biology Department CBD Computer Science Department CSD HumanComputer Interaction Institute HCII Software and Societal Systems Department S3D Its research and education focus is on software systems  which spans not only classical software engineering but also topics such as economics  social and organizational issues public policy  and privacy  S3D is a distinct entity from the Software Engineering Institute SEI SEI is a FFRDC  which is sponsored by the US Department of Defense and does not offer educational programs Language Technologies Institute LTI Machine Learning Department MLD Robotics Institute RI Gates and Hillman Centers  edit  Gates and Hillman Centers The Randy Pausch memorial bridge has LEDs that glow different colours at night The Gates Center for Computer Science and the Hillman Center for FutureGeneration Technologies are home to much of the School of Computer Science The 98 million complex was opened in 2009  3  It has 217000squarefoot 20200 m 2  of floor space including about 310 offices 11 conference rooms 32 labs 8000 square feet 740 m 2  of project space and the Planetary Robotics Center It also houses 12 classrooms including a 250seat auditorium  4  Additionally the Gates Center connects to the Purnell Center which houses the School of Drama via the Randy Pausch Memorial Footbridge The bridge represents Professor Pauschs own devotion to linking computer science and entertainment as he was a cofounder of Carnegie Mellons Entertainment Technology Center   5  Mack Scogin Merril Elam Architects of Atlanta  Georgia were the lead architects  3  The Gates and Hillman Centers have received LEED Gold Certification  6  Traditions  edit  Main article Carnegie Mellon University traditions Carnegie Mellons Mobot Races  now in their 14th year are hosted by the School of Computer Science during every Spring Carnival celebration The Mobots short for mobile robots  follow a slalom course painted in the sidewalk outside of Wean Hall The Mobot Races used to include a MoboJoust competition but it has not been held since 2002  7  to avoid damaging the Mobots  8  SCS Day is a yearly celebration of computer science that started in 2003 The event features a variety of activities including exhibits workshops and games in addition to an evening talent show  9  Smiley face  edit  SCS research professor Scott Fahlman is credited with the invention of the smiley face emoticon  He suggested the emoticon on an electronic board in 1982 as a way for board readers to know when an author was joking The text of Fahlmans original post was lost for nearly 20 years but was later recovered from backup tapes  10  19Sep82 1144 Scott E Fahlman  From Scott E Fahlman Fahlman at Cmu20c I propose that the following character sequence for joke markers  Read it sideways Actually it is probably more economical to mark things that are NOT jokes  given current trends For this use  Tartan Racing  edit  Tartan Racing is a collaboration between Carnegie Mellon and General Motors Corporation that competes in the DARPA Grand Challenge  The Grand Challenge is a competition for driverless cars sponsored by Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency DARPA Tartan Racing is led by Carnegie Mellon roboticist William L Red Whittaker   11  In 2007 Tartan Racing won the DARPA Urban Challenge  in which 11 autonomous ground vehicles raced over urban roadways In the challenge team vehicles were required to obey all California driving laws share the road with other drivers and robotic cars and complete the course in under six hours Tartan Racing won the 2 million cash prize with Boss a reworked 2007 Chevy Tahoe  Averaging about 14 miles 23 km an hour for a 55mile 89 km trip Boss beat the secondplace team Stanford Racing by just under 20 minutes  12  SCS honors and awards  edit  The School established a number of honors and awards  13  SCS
