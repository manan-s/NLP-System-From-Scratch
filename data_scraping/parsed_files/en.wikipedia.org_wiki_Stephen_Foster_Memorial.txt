namesake The memorials double red doors The memorial itself was conceived in 1927 when the Tuesday Musical Club founded in 1889 by affluent female musicians and University of Pittsburgh Chancellor John Bowman agreed to collaborate on a performance hall dedicated to Stephen Foster that would house the clubs recitals  21  Bowman donated land adjacent to where the foundation for the Cathedral of Learning was being laid for the memorial However little progress on the memorial was made until 1932 when Bowman learned of Josiah Kirby Lillys Foster Hall Collection After Lilly pledged more than 10000 Foster items fundraising began in earnest with almost half the 550000 cost coming from Lilly and his son Eli   15  Construction began January 13 1935 the 71st anniversary of Fosters death A dedication ceremony took place on June 2 1937 Pitts 150th anniversary  11   15  The Foster Hall Collection itself was established in 1930 by Josiah Kirby Lilly  noted for being the president of the prominent Indianapolis pharmaceutical manufacturer Eli Lilly and Company  The collection originally began as a retirement hobby based upon his lifelong love of Stephen Foster s music but it eventually grew into one of the major collections of American music and history Lilly and his staff with the help of some of Fosters relatives as well as through contributions prompted by the publication of the Foster Hall Bulletin accumulated over 10000 Foster items This initial collection was housed in Indianapolis in a small limestone building he called Foster Hall Before his effort began there had been no exact knowledge concerning the total number of Fosters works nor any accurate literature published about the composer Foster Halls staff identified 201 original works and Foster Hall became a resource center for John Tasker Howards biography Stephen Foster Americas Troubadour 1934 Concerned about the future of his collection Lilly donated the Foster Halls holdings to the University of Pittsburghs new Stephen Foster Memorial and the collection was moved to its new home in 1937 Since then some additional 20000 items reflecting Foster composers influenced by him and music in American life have been added  22  The universitys Center for American Music also houses the Ethelbert Nevin Collection which was previously housed in the Theodore M Finney Music Library until 1999 The Nevin Collection was acquired by the University of Pittsburgh between 1933 and 1956 The materials in the collection were either purchased or donated by Mrs Ethelbert Nevin other family members and friends The collection consists of original manuscripts letters mementos furnishings printed matter and special gifts  9  Aside from maintaining the collections and museum The Center for American Musics
