relocation efforts would require more staffing than they were able to provide At this point the Carnegie Institute under the leadership of Robert Wilburn  stepped in showing interest in merging with the Buhl Institute Both parties agreed to the merger in 1987 On October 5 1989 construction began on the 40 million building designed by local architect Tasso Katselas  which was renamed the Carnegie Science Center as a result of the merger  10  The Henry Buhl Jr Planetarium and Observatory was reinvented in this new facility The Center opened in October 1991  11  On January 23 2024 the Carnegie
