a reorganization of Minor League Baseball that resulted in a reduction from six classes to four TripleA DoubleA Class A and Rookie  in response to the general decline of the minors throughout the 1950s and early1960s when leagues and teams folded due to shrinking attendance caused by baseball fans preference for staying at home to watch MLB games on television The only change made within the next 27 years was Class A being subdivided for the first time to form Class A Short Season in 1966  2  Season TripleA DoubleA Class A Class A Short Season Rookie Refs 1963 Columbus Jets Asheville
