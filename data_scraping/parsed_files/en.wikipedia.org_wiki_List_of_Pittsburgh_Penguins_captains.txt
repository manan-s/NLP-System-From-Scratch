known as the Pens  are a professional ice hockey team based in Pittsburgh  The Penguins compete in the National Hockey League NHL as a member of the Metropolitan Division of the Eastern Conference  and have played their home games at PPG Paints Arena  originally known as Consol Energy Center since 2010 The team previously played at the Civic Arena  which was also known as Mellon Arena from 1999 to 2010 and by its nickname the Igloo The Penguins are affiliated with two minor league teams  the WilkesBarreScranton Penguins of the American Hockey League AHL and the Wheeling Nailers of the ECHL  Founded during the 1967 expansion  the Penguins have qualified for six Stanley Cup Finals  winning the Stanley Cup five times  in 1991  1992  2009  2016  and 2017  Along with the Edmonton Oilers  the Penguins are tied for the most Stanley Cup championships among the non Original Six teams and sixth overall With their Stanley Cup wins in 2016 and 2017 the Penguins became the first backtoback champions in the salary cap era Several of the teams former members have been inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame  including coowner Mario Lemieux  who purchased the Penguins in 1999 and brought the club out of bankruptcy Lemieux Jaromir Jagr  Sidney Crosby  and Evgeni Malkin have won the Hart Memorial Trophy while playing for the franchise Team history Early years 19671984 Prior to the arrival of the Penguins Pittsburgh had been the home of the NHLs Pittsburgh Pirates from 1925 to 1930 and of the American Hockey League s Pittsburgh Hornets franchise from 1936 to 1967 with a short break from 1956 to 1961 In the spring of 1965 Jack McGregor  a state senator from Kittanning Pennsylvania  began lobbying campaign contributors and community leaders to bring an NHL franchise back to Pittsburgh The group focused on leveraging the NHL as an urban renewal tool for Pittsburgh The senator formed a group of local investors that included H J Heinz Company heir H J Heinz III  Pittsburgh Steelers  owner Art Rooney and the Mellon family s Richard Mellon Scaife  The projected league expansion depended on securing votes from the thencurrent NHL owners  to ensure Pittsburgh would be selected as one of the expansion cities McGregor enlisted Rooney to petition votes from James D Norris  owner of the Chicago Black Hawks and his brother Bruce Norris  owner of the Detroit Red Wings  The effort was successful and on February 8 1966 the National Hockey League awarded an expansion team to Pittsburgh for the 196768 season  The Penguins paid 25 million 238 million today for their entry and 750000 69 million today more for startup costs The Civic Arena s capacity was boosted from 10732 to 12500 to meet the NHL requirements for expansion The Pens also paid an indemnification bill to settle with the Detroit Red Wings which owned the Pittsburgh Hornets franchise The investor group named McGregor president and chief executive officer and he represented Pittsburgh on the NHLs Board of Governors  5   6  The Civic Arena s capacity was increased to meet NHL requirements for a franchise The arena served as the Penguins home arena from 1967 to 2010 A contest was held where 700 of 26000 entries picked Penguins as the teams nickname sharing its nickname with the athletic department of the newly named Youngstown State University in nearby Youngstown Ohio  Youngstown is part of the Penguins territorial rights to this day though they did briefly share them with the Cleveland Barons in the mid1970s Mark Peters had the winning entry which was inspired because the team was to play in the Igloo the nickname of the Pittsburgh Civic Arena  7   8  a logo was chosen that had a penguin in front of a triangle which symbolized the  Golden Triangle  of downtown Pittsburgh  7   9  The Penguins first general manager Jack Riley  opened the first preseason camp for the franchise in Brantford Ontario   10  on September 13 1967 playing the franchises first exhibition match in Brantford against the Philadelphia Flyers on September 23 1967 Restrictive rules which kept most major talent with the existing Original Six teams hampered the Pens along with the rest of the expansion teams Beyond aging sniper Andy Bathgate  allstar defenseman Leo Boivin who had begun his professional career with the Hornets and New York Rangers  veteran Earl Ingarfield  a cast of former minor leaguers largely manned the first Penguins team Several players played for the Hornets the previous season Bathgate wingers Val Fonteyne and Ab McDonald  and goaltenders Hank Bassen and Joe Daley  George Sullivan was named the head coach for the clubs first two seasons and McDonald was named the teams first captain  11  On October 11 1967 league president Clarence Campbell and McGregor jointly dropped the ceremonial first puck of the Penguins opening home game against the Montreal Canadiens   5  On October 21 1967 they became the first team from the expansion class to defeat an Original Six team as they defeated the Chicago Black Hawks 42 However the Penguins went 273413 and finished in fifth place in the West Division missing the playoffs and ending with the thirdworst record in the league The teams best player proved to be longtime Cleveland Barons AHL goaltender Les Binkley  who recorded a 288 goalsagainst average and was second in the league with six shutouts Defensive winger Ken Schinkel won the teams sole league honor being named to represent the Penguins in the NHL AllStar Game  Bathgate led the team in scoring with 59 points but retired at seasons end McDonald who led the team in goals and was second in team scoring was also gone at seasons end traded to the St Louis Blues in exchange for center Lou Angotti   6  The next season saw the team slip in the standings amid a sharp drop in form by Binkley into sixth place and with the leagues worst record Several changes were made to improve the team resulting in Boivin and several others being traded and new playersincluding longtime future Pens star Jean Pronovost making their debuts No captain was named to replace McDonald the team went with four alternate captains Triumph of playoff berths and tragedy of Briere 19691974 Michel Briere s number was taken out of circulation after his careerending accident in 1970 It was later formally retired in 2001 In the 1969 draft the Penguins selected Michel Briere who although being chosen 26th was soon drawing comparisons to Phil Esposito and Bobby Clarke  Joining the team in November he finished as the secondplace rookie scorer in the NHL behind Bobby Clarke with 44 points 57th overall and third on the Penguins Briere placed second in Calder Memorial Trophy voting for Rookie of the Year honors behind Chicago goaltender Tony Esposito  Briere led Pittsburgh to its first NHL playoff berth since the 1928 Pirates The Penguins defeated the Oakland Seals in a fourgame sweep in the quarterfinals with Briere scoring the seriesclinching goal in overtime In the semifinal round defending conference champions St Louis Blues got the best of the Penguins during six games Briere led the team in playoff scoring recording five goals including three gamewinners and eight points Tragedy struck the Penguins just days after their playoff heroics On May 15 1970 Briere was in a car crash in his native Quebec  suffering brain trauma and slipping into a coma from which he would never recover he died a year later His number 21 jersey was never reissued remaining out of circulation until it was formally retired in 2001  6  In the 197071 season  the Penguins finished five games out of the playoffs with a 213720 record the fourthworst record in the league Pittsburgh achieved a playoff berth in 1972  only to be swept by the Chicago Black Hawks in the first round Except for a handful of players like Ken Schinkel Pronovost Syl Apps Jr  Keith McCreary  agitator Bryan Watson and goaltender Les Binkley talent was thin but enough for the Penguins to reach the playoffs in both 1970 and 1972 The Penguins battled the California Golden Seals for the division cellar in 1974  when Riley was fired as general manager and replaced by Jack Button  Button obtained Steve Durbano  Ab DeMarco  Bob Battleship Kelly and Bob Paradise through trades The personnel moves proved successful and the team improved to a 28419 record although they remained nine points away from a playoff berth However in early 1975 the Penguins creditors demanded payment of back debts forcing the team into bankruptcy  The doors to the teams offices were padlocked and it looked like the Penguins would fold or relocate  12  Around the same time rumors began circulating that the Penguins and the California Golden Seals were to be relocated to Seattle and Denver respectively the two cities that were to have been the sites of an expansion for the 197677 season   13  Through the intervention of a group that included former Minnesota North Stars head coach Wren Blair  the team was prevented from folding and remained in Pittsburgh eventually being bought by shopping mall magnate Edward J DeBartolo Sr Playoff runs and a uniform change 19741982 During the mid1970s Lowell MacDonald was paired with Syl Apps Jr and Jean Pronovost  forming the Century Line  MacDonald played with the Penguins from 1970 to 1978 Beginning in the mid1970s Pittsburgh iced some powerful offensive clubs led by the likes of the Century Line of Syl Apps Lowell MacDonald and Jean Pronovost They nearly reached the Stanley Cup semifinals in 1975  but were ousted from the playoffs by the New York Islanders in one of the only four bestofsevengame series in NHL history where a team came back from being down three games to none As the 1970s wore on a mediocre team defense neutralized the Penguins success beyond the regular season Baz Bastien  a former coach and general manager of the AHLs Hornets later became general manager The Penguins missed the playoffs in 197778  Bastien traded prime draft picks for several players whose best years were already behind them and the team would suffer in the early 1980s as a result The decade closed with a playoff appearance in 1979 and a rousing opening series win over the Buffalo Sabres before a secondround sweep at the hands of the Boston Bruins   6  The Penguins began the 1980s by changing their team colors in January 1980 the team switched from wearing blue and white to their presentday scheme of black and gold to honor Pittsburghs other sports teams the Pittsburgh Pirates and the Pittsburgh Steelers as well as the Flag of Pittsburgh  Both the Pirates and Steelers had worn black and gold for decades and both had enjoyed world championship seasons The Bruins protested this color change claiming a monopoly on black and gold but the Penguins defended their choice stating that the NHL Pirates also used black and gold as their team colors and that black and gold were Pittsburghs traditional sporting colors The NHL agreed and Pittsburgh could use black and gold The Penguins officially debuted the black and gold uniform in a game against the St Louis Blues at the Civic Arena on January 30 1980  14  On the ice the Penguins began the 1980s with defenseman Randy Carlyle  and prolific scorers Paul Gardner and Mike Bullard but little else During the early part of the decade the Penguins made a habit of being a tough draw for higherseeded opponents in the playoffs In 1980 the 13thseeded Penguins took the Bruins to the limit in their firstround playoff series The following season as the 15th seed they lost the decisive game of their firstround series in overtime to the heavily favored St Louis Blues Then in the 1982 playoffs  the Penguins held a 31 lead late in the fifth and final game of their playoff series against the reigning champions the New York Islanders However the Islanders rallied to force overtime and won the series on a goal by John Tonelli  who had tied the game before  15  It would be the Pens final playoff appearance until 1989  LemieuxJagr era 19842005 Mario Lemieux played for the Penguins in three stints 19841994 19951997 20002006 The team had the leagues worst record in both the 198283 and 198384 seasons With the team suffering financial problems it seemed the Penguins would either fold or relocate Mario Lemieux  one of the most highly touted NHL draft picks in history was due to be drafted in the 1984 NHL Entry Draft  Heading towards the end of the season ahead of the New Jersey Devils  who were placed last the Penguins made several questionable moves that appeared to weaken the team in the short term They posted three sixgame winless streaks in the last 21 games of the season and earned the right to draft Lemieux amidst protests from Devils management  16  Pittsburgh head coach Lou Angotti later admitted that a conscious decision was made to finish the season as the team with the worst record saying in an interview with the Pittsburgh PostGazette that a midseason lunch prompted the plan because there was a high chance of the franchise folding if Lemieux was not drafted  17  Other teams offered substantial trade packages for the draft choice but the Penguins kept the pick and drafted Lemieux first overall Lemieux paid dividends right away scoring on his firstever shot of his firstever NHL shift in his first NHL game However the team spent four more years out of the playoffs after his arrival In the late 1980s the Penguins finally gave Lemieux a strong supporting cast trading for superstar defenseman Paul Coffey from the Edmonton Oilers after the Oilers 1987 Stanley Cup win and bringing in young talent like scorers Kevin Stevens  Rob Brown and John Cullen from the minors The team finally acquired a topflight goaltender with the acquisition of Tom Barrasso from Buffalo All this talent had an immediate impact in helping Lemieux lead the Pens but the team struggled to make the playoffs The 198586 Pens missed the playoffs on the final day of the season by one game In 198687  they missed the playoffs by just two games and saw four teams with equal or worse records qualify In 198788  for the second time in a row the Penguins missed the playoffs by one game  11  In 1989 Pittsburgh finally broke through the barrier and made the playoffs on the back of Lemieux leading the league in goals assists and points On December 31 1988 Lemieux became the only player in history to score a goal in all five possible game situations in the same game even strength shorthanded penalty shot power play and empty net The Pens shocked the New York Rangers in a fourgame sweep in the first round however the Philadelphia Flyers halted their progress in the second round The sevengame defeat featured Lemieux scoring five goals in the fifth game  11  Golden Age 19891997 A herniated disc in Lemieuxs back cut short his 198990 season  although he still amassed 123 points However the Penguins fell out of the playoff picture They opted to strengthen their roster and support Lemieux in the 1990 offseason Freeagent signings  Bryan Trottier  and trades  Joe Mullen  Larry Murphy  Ron Francis and Ulf Samuelsson  played a major part in this Arguably no move was bigger during this time than when the Penguins drafted Jaromir Jagr with the fifth overall pick in the 1990 NHL Entry Draft  The first Czechoslovak player to be drafted into the NHL without first needing to defect to the West Jagr became the Penguins second franchise player and quickly developed into a superstar offensive talent The roster overhaul culminated in the Penguins winning their first Stanley Cup title by defeating the Minnesota North Stars in the Stanley Cup Finals in six games punctuated by an 80 victory in the deciding game the largest margin of victory in a final Stanley Cup game in over 80 years After the 1991 Stanley Cup Finals  the Penguins met with President George H W Bush  the first NHL team ever to visit the White House   18  The following season the team lost coach Bob Johnson to cancer  and Scotty Bowman took over as coach Under Bowman they swept the Chicago Blackhawks to repeat as Stanley Cup champions in 199192   6   11  Cancer revisited the Penguins in 1993 when Lemieux was tragically diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma  Only two months after the diagnosis missing 24 out of 84 games he came back to win his fourth Art Ross Trophy as scoring champion with 160 points edging out Pat LaFontaine and Adam Oates  Despite the office difficulties Pittsburgh finished with a 56217 record the franchises best regular season ever winning the Presidents Trophy  After Lemieuxs return the team played better than it ever had before winning an NHLrecord 17 consecutive games Despite all of this success the New York Islanders eliminated them in the second round of Game 7 in overtime  11   6  The Penguins continued to be a formidable team throughout the 1990s The stars of the Stanley Cup years were followed by the likes of forwards Alexei Kovalev  Martin Straka  Aleksey Morozov  Robert Lang and Petr Nedved  and defensemen Sergei Zubov  Darius Kasparaitis and Kevin Hatcher  Despite the departure of many of the franchises Stanley Cupwinning roster the Penguins fielded enough talent to reach the first round of the playoffs in 1994 where they lost to the Washington Capitals in six games the second round in 1995 where they lost to the New Jersey Devils in five games and the conference finals in 1996 where they lost to the Florida Panthers in seven games The 1997 playoffs marked a turning point as the Penguins suffered a firstround elimination at the hands of the rival Philadelphia Flyers in five games  11  Lemieuxs retirement and return 19972001 Lemieux with the Penguins during the 200001 season  his first season after coming out of retirement On April 6 1997 the franchise was rocked when Mario Lemieux citing ongoing health concerns and his disapproval with the way NHL hockey was being officiated announced he would retire at the conclusion of the 1997 playoffs Lemieux was so respected in the NHL and his achievements over the course of his career were so great that he was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in the year he retired the threeyear waiting period being waived His departure was the first in a series of events that would once again lead the Penguins into regular season stagnation and to the brink of financial ruin The Montreal Canadiens eliminated the team in the first round of the playoffs in 1998 despite being the secondseeded team in the East The following year their playoff run ended in the second round when they lost to the Toronto Maple Leafs in six games In 2000 the Penguins stunned the highly touted Washington Capitals 41 in the first round only to fall to the Philadelphia Flyers 42 in the second round By this time the lofty contracts handed out during the early 1990s were catching up with the Penguins At one point the team owed over 90 million to numerous creditors leading thenowners Howard Baldwin and Morris Belzberg who bought the Penguins after their first Stanley Cup win to ask the players to defer their salaries to help pay the bills When the deferred salaries finally came due combined with other financial pressures the Penguins were forced to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in November 1998 Lemieux then stepped in with an unusual proposal to buy the team out of bankruptcy The Penguins owed Lemieux 325 million in deferred salary making him the teams largest individual creditor He proposed recovering this money by converting it into equityenough to give him controlling interest He also vowed to keep the team in Pittsburgh The NHL and the courts agreed and Lemieux with help from supermarket tycoon Ronald Burkle  assumed control on September 3 1999 saving the franchise for the second time  6  Lemieux again shocked the hockey world by announcing at a press conference on December 8 2000 his intentions to return to the Penguins as an active player On December 27 2000 Lemieux stepped onto NHL ice for the first time in 44 months officially becoming the first playerowner in NHL history Lemieux helped lead the Penguins deep into the 2001 playoffs  highlighted by an overtime victory against the Buffalo Sabres in Game 7 of the second round Darius Kasparaitis scored the seriesclinching goal to advance the Penguins to the Eastern Conference Finals where they lost in five games to the New Jersey Devils  6  Rebuilding 20012005 MarcAndre Fleury was drafted first overall in 2003 by the Penguins The Penguins attendance had dwindled in the late 1990s In 199899 the club had an average attendance of 14825 at home games the lowest it had been since Lemieuxs rookie year  19  Reducing revenue on top of the previous bankruptcy necessitated salary shedding The biggest salary move was the trading of superstar Jaromir Jagr to the Washington Capitals in the summer of 2001 The Penguins missed the playoffs for the first time in 12 years in 2002  finishing in a tie for thirdtolast in their conference The following season they finished secondlast In the 2003 NHL Entry Draft  the Penguins selected goaltender MarcAndre Fleury with the first overall pick  20   21  The 200304 season was an ordeal with Lemieux missing all but 24 regular season games with a hip injury and attendance dipping to an average of 11877 the lowest average of any NHL team with just one sellout  19  As the season progressed the Penguins signed new head coach and former Penguins player and commentator Eddie Olczyk and opted not to include Fleury in the lineup for the bulk of the season This culminated in the worst record in the NHL with the team winning just 23 games As in the 1980s the Penguins struggles were fortuitously concurrent with a string of NHL Entry Draft classes that would yield multiple worldclass talents The Penguins lost out on the first overall pick for the 2004 NHL Entry Draft  Alexander Ovechkin  which went to the Washington Capitals However Ovechkins countryman center Evgeni Malkin  was similarly highly regarded and Pittsburgh took him with the second overall pick However a transfer dispute between the NHL and the International Ice Hockey Federation IIHF delayed his Pittsburgh debut  22  By this point the Penguins had collapsed financially since the Stanley Cupwinning years of the early 1990s Their home venue the Civic Arena had become the oldest arena in the NHL and Lemieux had tried unsuccessfully to cut a deal with the city for a new facility With Pittsburgh uninterested in building a new hockey arena for the struggling Penguins Lemieux began looking into the possibilities of selling or relocating the team to Kansas City Missouri   23   24   25   26  A lockout prompted the cancellation of the 200405 NHL season  One of the many reasons for the lockout included disagreements on resolving the financial struggles of teams like the Penguins and the Ottawa Senators  which had filed for bankruptcy protection  27  During the lockout the Penguins players dispersed between the clubs American Hockey League AHL affiliate the WilkesBarreScranton Penguins  and to European leagues  6  CrosbyMalkin era 2005present Sidney Crosby during his sophomore season with the Penguins He was drafted first overall by the team in the 2005 draft  With the lockout resolved in 2005 the NHL organized an unprecedented draft lottery to set the 2005 NHL Entry Draft selection order The draft lottery which was held behind closed doors in a secure location resulted in the Penguins being awarded the first overall pick  28   29   30  Quebec Major Junior Hockey League QMJHL superstar Sidney Crosby who had been training with Lemieux over the summer  28  was the consensus first overall pick with many referring to the draft lottery process as The Sidney Crosby Sweepstakes The Penguins selected Crosby on July 30 2005 with the top pick instantly rekindling interest in hockey in Pittsburgh  11  The Penguins began rebuilding the team under the salary cap However Evgeni Malkin the Penguins 2004 draft pick could not report to Pittsburgh immediately because of a playing rights dispute with the Russian Superleague  The addition of Crosby paid instant dividends with attendance rising by approximately 4000 per game on average in the 200506 season  19  However Crosbys presence did not immediately translate into wins as the team began the season with a long winless skid that resulted in a head coaching change from Olczyk to Michel Therrien  Then on January 24 2006 Lemieux announced his second retirement after developing an irregular heartbeat  this time permanently He finished as the NHLs seventh alltime scorer 1723 eighth in goals 690 and tenth in assists 1033 and with the secondhighest career points per game average 188 which is second to Wayne Gretzky s 192  31   32  Despite the teams struggles Crosby established himself as a star in the league amassing 102 points in his debut season and finishing second to Alexander Ovechkin for the Calder Memorial Trophy awarded each year to the leagues top rookie In the Penguins final game of the season Crosby tallied a goal and an assist to become the topscoring rookie in Penguin history eclipsing Lemieux The Penguins again posted the worst record in the Eastern Conference and the highest goalsagainst total in the League They received the second overall draft pick their fourth toptwo pick in four years in the 2006 NHL Entry Draft  and selected touted twoway forward Jordan Staal  The team announced on April 20 they would not renew the contract for general manager Craig Patrick  who had been the general manager since December 1989  33  On May 25 Ray Shero signed a fiveyear contract as general manager Runnerup and Third Stanley Cup title 20062010 Evgeni Malkin made an immediate impact driving the Penguins to their first playoff appearance in six years Change came for the Penguins on October 18 2006 when Evgeni Malkin made his NHL debut He set the modern NHL record with a goal in each of his first six games Malkin would record points in 16 consecutive games  34  The Penguins finished the 200607 season in fifth place in the Eastern Conference with a record of 472411 totaling 105 points only two points behind the Atlantic Division winners the New Jersey Devils It was the franchises first 100point season in 11 years and represented an enormous 47point leap from the previous season In the first round of the 2007 playoffs the eventual Stanley Cup runnersup the Ottawa Senators defeated the Penguins 41 At the seasons end rookies Malkin and Jordan Staal were finalists for the Calder Memorial Trophy awarded to the Rookie of the Year which Malkin won On March 13 2007 Pennsylvanias Governor Ed Rendell  Allegheny County Chief Executive Dan Onorato  Pittsburgh Mayor Luke Ravenstahl and Mario Lemieux of the Penguins ownership group announced an agreement had been reached among the parties to build the longsought arena The stateoftheart multipurpose facility the Consol Energy Center  guaranteed that the Penguins would remain in the city of Pittsburgh Following the announcement of the plan the Lemieux ownership group announced they no longer had plans to sell the team On June 8 2007 a 325 million bond was issued and the Penguins signed a 30year lease on September 19 binding them to the city of Pittsburgh through 2040  35  After a mediocre start to the 200708 season  Crosby and starting goaltender MarcAndre Fleury were both injured longterm due to high right ankle sprains In their absence the team flourished because of the play and leadership of Malkin On April 2 2008 the Penguins clinched the Atlantic Division titletheir first division title in 10 yearswith a 42 win against rivals the Philadelphia Flyers Malkin finished the season with 106 points for second place in the league and finished as a finalist for the Hart Memorial Trophy  The team launched into their first extended playoff run in many years beating Ottawa 40 defeating the New York Rangers 41 and then defeating the Philadelphia Flyers 41 to clinch the Prince of Wales Trophy  Pittsburgh lost the 2008 Stanley Cup Finals to the Detroit Red Wings in six games finishing the playoffs with a 146 record Crosby finished the playoffs with 27 points 6 goals and 21 assists in 20 games tying Conn Smythe Trophy winner Henrik Zetterberg 13 goals and 14 assists in 22 games for the playoff scoring lead Crosby Bill Guerin  and Chris Kunitz during the 2009 Stanley Cup Finals  The Penguins defeated the Detroit Red Wings in the Finals earning their third Stanley Cup title In the 200809 season  Malkin won the Art Ross and was again a candidate for the Hart Memorial Trophy Crosby finished third in League scoring with 33 goals and 70 assists for 103 points despite missing five games The Penguins record dipped midseason but lifted after Dan Bylsma replaced head coach Therrien The effect was almost instantaneous and the Penguins recovered enough to secure homeice advantage in their firstround match up against the Philadelphia Flyers whom the Penguins defeated in six games It took seven games for the Penguins to win the next series against Washington sending them to the Eastern Conference Finals where they eliminated the Carolina Hurricanes in a fourgame sweep After defeating the Hurricanes the Penguins earned their second consecutive trip to the Stanley Cup Finals against the Detroit Red Wings to whom they lost the previous year After losing Games 1 and 2 in Detroit  like the previous years the Penguins won Games 3 and 4 in Pittsburgh Each team won on home ice in Games 5 and 6 In Game 7 in Detroit Maxime Talbot scored two goals including the gamewinner as the Penguins won 21 to win their third Stanley Cup title  36  Malkin was awarded the Conn Smythe Trophy as the MVP of the playoffs  11  During the 200910 season  Crosby scored 109 points 51 goals and 58 assists in 81 games winning the Maurice Rocket Richard Trophy as the NHL seasons leading goalscorer The Penguins seeded fourth in the East began their title defense defeating the Ottawa Senators in six games In the next round the Penguins faced the Montreal Canadiens The teams swapped wins in the series en route to the decisive Game 7 which the Penguins lost 52 ending their season and their tenure at Mellon Arena  37  New arena and injuries 20102015 Outside of Consol Energy Center now PPG Paints Arena in March 2010 before it officially opened The Penguins hosted the Washington Capitals at Heinz Field during the 2011 NHL Winter Classic  In 201011  the Penguins played their first game in the Consol Energy Center On February 11 2011 the Pittsburgh PenguinsNew York Islanders brawl took place  38  A

being moved something that would change decades later when the team faced another relocation threat While the drafting of Mario Lemieux piqued interest in hockey locally fans remained skeptical John

encompassing the logo was later removed  86  The teams colors were originally powder blue  navy blue  and white The powder blue was changed to royal blue in 1973 but returned in 1977 The team adopted the current black and gold color scheme in 1980 to unify the colors of the citys professional sports teams although like the Pittsburgh Pirates and the Steelers the shade of gold more closely resembled yellow The change was not without controversy as the Boston Bruins protested by claiming to own the rights to the black and gold colors However the Penguins cited the colors worn by the nowdefunct NHL team the Pittsburgh Pirates in the 1920s as well as black and gold being the official colors of the City of Pittsburgh and its namesake and obtained permission to use the black and gold

2008 Winter Classic uniform having been retired  91  Called the Blue Jerseys of Doom by the Pittsburgh TribuneReview  the alternate jerseys were worn when Sidney Crosby sustained a broken jaw and when

City of Champions patch and a variation of the skating penguin logo  96  This design served as the basis for the teams third uniform which was unveiled in the 201819 season and was also partly inspired by the early 1980s gold uniforms  97  The Penguins wore monochrome black uniforms minus the white elements when they faced the Flyers again in the 2019 NHL Stadium Series   98  In 2021 the Penguins wore white Reverse Retro uniforms based on the 199297 uniforms This set replaced the flying penguin with the alternate skating penguin logo minus the gold triangle on the shoulders  99  A black version served as the replacement for the gold alternate uniforms starting in the 202122 season  100  In the 202223 season the Penguins unveiled their second Reverse Retro uniform this time
