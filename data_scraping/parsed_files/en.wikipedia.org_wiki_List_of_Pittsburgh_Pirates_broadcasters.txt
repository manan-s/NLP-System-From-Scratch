hide From Wikipedia the free encyclopedia Forbes Field wall  2006 The Pittsburgh Pirates are members of Major League Baseball MLB they have employed sportscasters to provide playbyplay and color commentary during games broadcast over the radio and on television On August 5 1921 Pittsburgh hosted the first baseball game broadcast over the radio Harold Arlin  a foreman at Westinghouse  announced the game over KDKA from a box seat next to the first base dugout at Forbes Field   1   2   3  Throughout the 1920s and 1930s occasional games would be broadcast until Rosey Rowswell became the first Voice of the Pirates in 1936  4  While most of Roswells early broadcasts were solo he was joined by Pirates coowner Bing Crosby and his successor Bob Prince for games  4  Prince took over as lead broadcaster in 1955 and held the position over the next 20 seasons Prince gained a reputation for giving players nicknames and inventing catchphrases to describe the game he was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in August 1986  5  After the Pirates fired Bob Prince and his sidekick Nellie King after the 1975 season they hired Milo Hamilton away from Atlanta to be the lead broadcaster and brought Lanny Frattare from their minor league affiliate to be the second announcer After Hamilton left after the 1979 season Frattare held the position for 29 yearsthe longest tenure of any Pirates broadcaster  6  Upon Frattares retirement after the 2008 season Greg Brown took over the role as lead broadcaster  7  Multiple people have held temporary positions as broadcasters including former players Don Hoak  Dave Giusti  Willie Stargell  and Pittsburgh Penguins  broadcaster Mike Lange   8  WWSWFM broadcast Pirates games on the radio during the 1940s and 1950s until KDKA became the franchises flagship station in 1955  9  In 2006 the Pirates switched to WPGB in an attempt to reach younger age brackets under the contract WPGB carried Pirates games though the 2011 season  10  Starting with the 2012 season KDKAFM took over as the flagship station of the Pirates Radio Network As of 2016 the Pirates Radio Network has stations located in Pennsylvania West Virginia Ohio and Maryland TV  radio broadcasters  edit  Go ball get outta here Lanny Frattare after a Pirates home run  11  There are a reported 15000 people at the game this
