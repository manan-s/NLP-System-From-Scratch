by Jonathan Borofsky Walking to the Sky Artist Jonathan Borofsky Year 2004  2004  Type Sculpture Location Nasher Sculpture Center  Dallas Walking to the Sky is an outdoor sculpture by Jonathan

Mellon University in Pittsburgh  Pennsylvania  United States   1  Another copy is installed in front of the Kiturami Homsys Co building in Hwagokdong Gangseogu Seoul  South Korea   2  The seventon work depicts a little girl a businesswoman a young man and several others scaling a soaring 100foottall stainless steel pole Three people are looking upward from the base of the pole which points to the east at a 75degree angle A similar work by Borofsky entitled Woman Walking to the Sky is installed in the center of Strasbourg France near the memorial for the synagogue that was destroyed by the Nazi occupiers of the city in 1940  3  The piece was inspired by a story that Borofskys father used to tell him when he was a child about a friendly giant who lived in the sky In each tale father and son would travel up to the sky to talk to the giant about what needed to be done for everyone back on earth The artist says the sculpture is a celebration of the human potential for discovering who we are and where we need to go  4  Carnegie Mellon University replica  edit  Carnegie Mellon installed Walking to the Sky in May 2006 on its campus in front of Warner Hall just off Forbes Avenue The sculpture was a gift from CMU Trustee Jill Gansman Kraus A74 and her husband Peter Kraus of New York City  The sculpture generated controversy among the student body for its appearance the choice of location and the lack of campus involvement in selecting and siting the piece The campus newspaper described it as an eyesore and a huge phallus while others have expressed displeasure at its location as one of the first things seen of the campus from Forbes Avenue Due to apparent structural instability the sculpture had to be replaced in October 2009  5  References  edit  Wikimedia Commons has
