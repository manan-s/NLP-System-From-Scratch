social issues In 1965 they sponsored a conference on urban problems in which they began discussions with the University of Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon University to create a school focused on public affairs  In 1967 Carnegie Mellon President H Guyford Stever  Richard M Cyert  Dean of the Tepper School of Business  and Professors William W Cooper and Otto Davis met and formed a universitywide committee to discuss creating a school that would train leaders to address complex problems in American urban communities  Davis was asked to draft a proposal to create such a school and focused on applying the Tepper School of Business pioneering quantitative and skillbased approach to management education as well as technology to public sector problems In 1968 William Cooper and Otto Davis presented the final proposal for the School of Urban and Public Affairs SUPA to the Richard King Mellon Foundation The proposal found favor with R K Mellon and he became strongly committed to creating such a school The R K Mellon Foundation sent a proposal to President Stever to finance it with an initial grant of 10 million and on 1 November 1968 President Stever created the School of Urban and Public Affairs with William Cooper as the first dean The school initially drew much of its faculty from the Tepper School of Business and was based in the Margaret Morrison Carnegie Hall Eventually the school became independent of other colleges within the university and moved to its current location in historic Hamburg Hall when the facility was acquired by the university from the US Bureau of Mines  Subsequent Deans include Otto Davis Brian Berry  Joel A Tarr Alfred Blumstein  former Carnegie Mellon Provost Mark Kamlet Linda C Babcock  Jeffrey Hunker  Mark Wessel  and current dean Ramayya Krishnan  In 1992 Teresa Heinz donated a large sum of money to the school which was then renamed as the H John Heinz III School of Public Policy and Management in honor of Mrs Heinzs late husband Senator H John Heinz III Senator Heinz heir to the H J Heinz Company fortune had been killed when his small private plane crashed one year before  5  In 2007 the Heinz School received a grant from the Heinz Foundations that transformed the school into a college and formalized the School of Information Systems  Management alongside the School of Public Policy  Management under the colleges administration The official launch of the H John Heinz III College of Information Systems and Public Policy was held on October 24 2008 during Carnegie Mellons Homecoming weekend and was led by Dean Krishnan Teresa Heinz and former United States Secretary of the Treasury Paul ONeill   6  Facilities  edit  Hamburg Hall  home of the Heinz College Heinz College is headquartered in Hamburg Hall a
