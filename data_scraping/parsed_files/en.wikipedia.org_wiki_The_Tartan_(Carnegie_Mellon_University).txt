contributors making decisions about the articles photographs and art pieces submitted by the regular staff The Editorial Staff is divided into editors and managers Editors deal directly with the assigning production and processing of content while managers coordinate their staffs to provide a service to the publication As a general rule people are voted into the Editorial Staff by their peers Editorial Board  edit  The Editorial Board is a subgroup of the Editorial Staff charged with formulating and communicating the newspapers formal opinion every week Each issue contains between one and three editorials marked From the Editorial Board all of which are written by Editorial Board members and vetted by the entire Board before publication The Board is appointed by the EditorinChief and approved by a majority vote of the Editorial Staff Regular Staff  edit  Students are considered a junior staff writer after joining the newspaper After contributing to six issues or having two published articles in each of two separate sections the student becomes a full staff writer After a year of regular contribution the staff writer is eligible to become a senior staff writer a position which confers no tangible benefits but senior staff do get their names in the masthead each week Events and controversies  edit  A brief independence 20022004  edit  In 2002 The Tartan s leadership decided to leave the student funding process of Carnegie Mellon University Advertising revenues were healthy and the papers leadership was confident that the paper could remain independent so long as future leadership maintained a strong focus on maintaining and growing revenue from advertising and subscriptions Breaking away was also an attempt to remove the ethical burden of reporting on the same entities that allocated funds to the newspaper The paper failed to grow and maintain its advertising income and accumulated a large amount of debt by 2004 The Tartan rejoined the student funding process in the spring of 2004 Missing website 2004  edit  In the spring of 2004 a disgruntled staff member accessed The Tartan s servers and removed the code for The Tartan  s Web site along with the content of the site shortly after leaving a meeting in which the editorinchief failed to nominate him for a contributing editor position A complaint was filed with campus police and the University held a disciplinary hearing in which the committee determined the code belonged to the former staff member Since then The Tartan has rebuilt its internal and external Web sites from scratch Controversy April 2004  edit  The Tartan has traditionally published an annual joke issue called the Natrat  Tartan spelled backwards on April Fools Day In the 2004 edition a comic containing a racial slur for African Americans and a joke about murdering an African American along with other offensive items including a poem about the fatal rape of a woman with an ice skate blade was published Jim Puls the editorinchief and Alex Meseguer the managing editor resigned in the wake of the ensuing media attention and campus outcry  1   2  Bob Rost the artist of the offending cartoon was also dismissed from the newspaper  3  Controversy November 2004  edit  In November 2004 The Tartan declined to run an advertisement submitted by conservative writer David Horowitz  Horowitz has gained publicity by placing or attempting to place similar ads in a number of student newspapers across the country This action caused The Tartan to once again gain media attention this time drawing fire from conservatives who viewed the paper as having a liberal agenda  4   5  References  edit   CMU slur brings apology  Furor over First Amendment CMU editors assailed over spoof paper  Editors escape
