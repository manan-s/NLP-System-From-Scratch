annually with a parade  9  The area as of 2017 was about 17 Asian  10  History  edit  Origins  edit  The name Squirrel Hill may have been given to the area by the Native Americans who lived in its vicinity  11  The neighborhood most likely was named for the abundance of black squirrels   12  The growth and development of Squirrel Hill was initially focused on the riverfront along the Monongahela River  The first recorded house was built in 1760 by a soldier at nearby Fort Pitt  Colonel James Burd at a place called Summerset on the Monongahela River Squirrel Hills next house was built by Ambrose Newton some time in the 1760s This house is still standing and is located in what is now Schenley Park along Overlook Drive near the ice skating rink Its first business district was the intersection of Browns Hill Road and Beechwood Boulevard In 1778 John Turner built his estate of Federal Hill nearby along what is now Beechwood Boulevard He later established the Turner cemetery in 1838 inside his estate which he donated to the local community when he died in 1840  11  This cemetery holds the remains of many of the original settlers of Squirrel Hill The Mary S Brown Memorial Methodist church was also built on adjoining lands donated by Turner This church was rebuilt several times but the current building which dates from 1908 is the oldest standing church in Squirrel Hill  13  The third house in Squirrel Hill Neill Log House  was built by Robert Neill around 1765 also in what is now Schenley Park This house still exists and is occasionally open to the public The Neills owned 262 acres 106 km 2  of land in the northern section of Schenley Park In 1795 the Neills moved from this house to a location in what is now Market Square in downtown Pittsburgh  After they died the house was handed down to two different people before it was sold to General James OHara  OHaras granddaughter Mary Schenley gave the property to the city of Pittsburgh in 1889 For a time the house was rented out by the city to vacationers but by 1969 the house was in such poor condition that it was dismantled and rebuilt by the Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation  It still exists and is open for tours during the Vintage Grand Prix in July Around 1820 William Killymoon Stewart built one of the first tavern inns in the area His tavern located near the intersection of Beechwood and Browns Hill Road survived for over 100 years Slowly Squirrel Hill became a prosperous and affluent suburb Around 1840  14  the Murdoch family started  15   16  a farm and nursery business in the part of Squirrel Hill North which is known today as Murdoch Farms  17   18   19  Today this quiet area contains many upscale homes By the 1860s the area along Fifth Avenue near Woodland Road had several mansions including Willow Cottage The cottage was built by the industrialist and civic leader Thomas M Howe  a bank president and member of the US House of Representatives from 1851 to 1855 Though neglected for many years and almost torn down Willow Cottage has recently undergone a 22 million restoration and renovation into a Chatham University gatehouse and guesthouse Civil War  edit  On December 24 1860 protests broke out in the streets of Squirrel Hill after news arrived that the US Secretary of War John B Floyd had ordered 124 cannons to be shipped from Allegheny Arsenal to two forts under construction in Louisiana and Texas   20  The inhabitants of Pittsburgh predicted that these weapons would be used against them if the South seceded and this did indeed happen at Fort Sumter  21  Incorporation into Pittsburgh  edit  Murray Avenue in Squirrel Hill looking north near Darlington Road circa 1937 The electric trolley lines are clearly visible running down the center of the street Prior to 1868 the Squirrel Hill area was part of Peebles Township  This changed in 1868 when the area was annexed to the city of Pittsburgh  Following the Civil War several of Pittsburghs richest families built multiple houses in the Woodland Road area between Fifth and Wilkins Avenues In 1869 a womens college the predecessor to Chatham University  was established nearby Today Chatham University owns several of these large houses In 1869 the clubhouse of the Pittsburgh Golf Club was built at the new Schenley Park Golf Course The present building by Alden and Harlow was constructed in 1900 In 1876 the Homewood Cemetery was established on 176 acres 071 km 2  of land in Squirrel Hill  11  Over the course of the 19th century the focus of Squirrel Hill shifted from its riverfront at the Monongahela River to the area closest to Oakland and Shadyside  Ebdys orchard was located near Shady Avenue and Murdochs farm known for its flowers fruit trees and vegetable trees was located on the hill above Oakland By the late 1800s the building of trolley lines caused a migration of wealthy executives outwards toward country estates and workers inward toward trolley lines Farms were sold and divided for new housing developments  22  Inside the Squirrel Hill Tunnel  which runs underneath the southern half of Squirrel Hill The growth of Squirrel Hill accelerated when an electric trolley was installed in 1893  11  The trolley line ran via Forbes Avenue and Murray Avenue terminating in Homestead  The trolley line facilitated the building of hundreds of houses for the middle management of local factories especially on Shady and Denniston Avenues near Aylesboro Despite its trolley line Murray Avenue remained a dirt road until 1920 Murray Avenue carried three Pittsburgh Railways trolley lines 69 Squirrel Hill 60 East LibertyHomestead and 68 HomesteadDuquesne Kennywood McKeesport until 1958 when the trolleys were replaced by buses Bus routes 61A 61B 61C 61D 64 67 and 69 pass through the area today Squirrel Hill grew even more with the opening of the Boulevard of the Allies in 1927 providing a direct link to downtown Pittsburgh  By the 1930s most of the available land in Squirrel Hill had been filled In 1953 the Parkway and Squirrel Hill Tunnel were opened They gave the area easier and quicker access from surrounding neighborhoods  11  Cultural life  edit  Squirrel Hills business area along Forbes and Murray avenues is referred to as upstreet a contraction of up the street by locals In addition to the many retail businesses in the neighborhood there are a number of longtime nonprofit organizations including a branch of the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh  the Jewish Community Center of Greater Pittsburgh  23  the Jewish Family  Childrens Service of Pittsburgh  23   24  the Childrens Institute of Pittsburgh   23  and the Squirrel Hill Urban Coalition  25  Many annual events are hosted in Squirrel Hill by various community organizations Parks  edit  Chatham University Arboretum  located in the north of Squirrel Hill Squirrel Hill contains several naturerelated points of interest They include the Chatham University Arboretum  originally belonging to Andrew Mellon  Schenley Park  and Frick Park  In 1889 Schenley Park was established on land donated from Mary Schenley  whose grandfather had been the owner of considerable amounts of land in the area The original size of the park was 120 acres 049 km 2  though it eventually expanded to 456 acres 185 km 2  over the years  11  When Henry Clay Frick died in 1919 he bequeathed 150 acres 061 km 2  of undeveloped land to the City of Pittsburgh for use as a public park He provided a 2 million trust fund to assist with the maintenance of the park Frick Park on the eastern border of the Squirrel Hill neighborhood opened in 1927 Between 1919 and 1942 money from the trust fund was used to enlarge the park increasing its size to almost 600 acres 24 km 2  In February 2004 Frick Park grew with the addition of the Nine Mile Run stream restoration area which flows to the Monongahela River  The United States Army Corps of Engineers managed the restoration funded with 5 million in federal money and 27 million raised by the city  26  The restoration was completed in 2006 Jewish community  edit  See also History of the Jews in Pittsburgh The origins of Squirrel Hills Jewish community dates from the 1920s when Eastern European Jews began to move to the neighborhood in large numbers from Oakland and the Hill District  Many of them took up residence in rows of brick houses on the cross streets of Murray Avenue south of Forbes  such as Darlington Road Bartlett Street and Beacon Street The neighborhood became the center of Jewish culture in the city with kosher butcher shops delicatessens Jewish restaurants bookstores and designer boutiques Several hundred Russian Jewish immigrants moved to the neighborhood in the 1990s  6  A 2017 study of the Greater Pittsburgh Jewish community conducted by researchers at Brandeis University and commissioned by the local Jewish Federation found that 26 of Pittsburgharea Jews live in Squirrel Hill 20 live in the South Hills  9 live in the North Hills  31 live in other areas of Pittsburgh and 14 live in other areas of the region Although Squirrel Hill remains the traditional center of Jewish life in the region the study found a shift to more suburban areas The study also found an increase in the population of Jews who identify as Orthodox or secular and a decrease in the number of Jews who identify as Conservative and Reform denominations  27  This feature of Squirrel Hill and surrounding Jewish communities sustained locations of Jewish life across time and denominations makes the area unusual compared to Jewish life in other cities Elsewhere Jews tended to migrate in waves to suburban areas during the twentieth century and more geographic separation exists between denominations compared to Pittsburgh  28  All of Squirrel Hill as well as much of the neighboring neighborhoods of Greenfield and Regent Square  is within an eruv  a symbolic enclosure that allows Orthodox Jews carry items or push a stroller on Shabbat the Jewish sabbath during which certain activities are not permitted  29  Moving items from private domain to a public domain is not permitted on Shabbat so an eruv creates a single private shared space and carrying within it is permitted  29  The irregular boundaries of the eruv are such that as one writer noted an Orthodox Jew could carry something within the eruv  s boundaries all the way from the north end of the Hot Metal Bridge to the intersection of Wilkins and South Dallas in Point Breeze   30  Squirrel Hill contains three Jewish day schools two are affiliated with the Chabad and Modern Orthodox movements respectively  31   32  while Community Day School is a coed independent Jewish day school in the neighborhood that attracts families across the wide spectrum of Jewish belief and practice  33  Antisemitic attacks  edit  Main article Murder of Neal Rosenblum On April 17 1986 Neal Rosenblum a 24yearold rabbinical student visiting from Toronto  was shot and killed near his inlaws house in Squirrel Hill  34  A suspect 45yearold Steven M Tielsch was arrested in 2000  34  after bragging to a fellow prison inmate that he had killed a Jew  35  Tielschs first three trials ended in a deadlocked jury  he was convicted of thirddegree murder in a fourth trial in 2002  36  The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania upheld the decision in 2007  36  Main article Pittsburgh synagogue shooting On October 27 2018 Robert Bowers entered the Tree of Life  Or LSimcha synagogue during Shabbat morning services and opened fire  killing 11 people and injuring six including four police officers  37  Education  edit  Carnegie Mellon University Public schools  edit  The Free Public School Act of 1834 ordered school districts not only to establish free schools but also to establish them in townships outside city limits  38  This affected Squirrel Hill since it was part of Peebles Township at the time John Turner who never learned to read or write but became a wealthy landowner left land and money to the community to build a school when he died in 1844 at the age of 83 It was called Squirrel Hill School and was located on Bigelow Street at Hazelwood Avenue in the Greenfield neighborhood Its successor closed in 1915 and was replaced by Roosevelt School named for thenpresident Theodore Roosevelt  It closed in 1957 It was replaced by John Minadeo Elementary School named for a ninthgrade school crossing guard who gave his life to save a group of young students in the path of a runaway car near Gladstone School  39   40  The Wightman School closed in 1980 and the building is now used as a community center After Peebles Township was annexed by Pittsburgh in 1868 Squirrel Hill became the Colfax School District named for Schuyler Colfax  who was Vice President of the United States under President Ulysses S Grant  The district had five numbered schools Colfax No 1 was located at Phillips Avenue and Beechwood Boulevard Today it is Pittsburgh Colfax K8 Colfax No 2 was on Beechwood Boulevard near the intersection of Saline Street and Hazelwood Avenue near Browns Hill Road It closed in 1907 but was reopened in 1916 as the Roosevelt School Annex when Roosevelt became overcrowded The annex closed in 1939 Colfax No 3 on Forward Avenue became Forward Avenue School and was named after Walter Forward  who was appointed US Secretary of the Treasury by President John Tyler  The school was torn down in 1923 but its retaining wall still exists under the Parkway East bridge over Saline Street Colfax No 4 at Whipple and Commercial streets became Swisshelm School and was named for Jane Swisshelm  a writer and abolitionist Colfax No 5 at Solway and Wightman streets became Wightman School and was named for Thomas Wightman owner of the Thomas Wightman Glass Company Wightman operated as a school from 1897 to 1980 and since then has been used as a community center building and the home of Carriage House Childrens Center The building underwent extensive restoration and remodeling to make it one of only two older buildings in Western Pennsylvania to have LEED Gold certification  40  Taylor Allderdice High School Two other public elementary schools
