robotics technologies to build functional prototype systems from concept to commercialization   1  A typical NREC project includes a rapid proofofconcept demonstration followed by an indepth development and testing phase that produces a robust prototype with intellectual property for licensing and commercialization Throughout this process NREC applies best practices for software development  system integration  and field testing Sponsors and partners include industrial companies technology startups  and federal agencies such as DARPA  the Department of Transportation  NASA  the Air Force Research Laboratory  and the US Army Corps of Engineers  NRECs research model is based on Creative design and engineering on all levels and across all disciplines Rapid prototyping using inhouse fabrication capabilities Collaboration with sponsors to commercialize technology NREC history  edit  In 1994 the Carnegie Mellon Field Robotics Center scientists realized that the mobile robotics field was mature enough for commercial application in agriculture construction mining utilities and other markets Consequently the National Robotics Engineering Consortium NREC was chartered with a mission to develop and transition robotic technology to industry and federal agencies Original funding for the center included 25 million seed funding from NASA   1  In 1996 the organization moved to its current facility in Pittsburghs Lawrenceville neighborhood and was renamed the National Robotics Engineering Center The NREC is housed in a renovated 100000squarefoot foundry building on

Years Project case studies  edit  DARPA robotics challenge  edit  CHIMP is a humansized robot that when standing is 5foot2inches tall and weighs about 400 pounds Tartan Rescue Team engineers designed CHIMP to work in dangerous degraded environments that were built for people not robots CHIMP operates semiautonomously and can plan and carry out highlevel instructions given by its operator Its nearhuman form strength precision and dexterity enable it to perform complex humanlevel tasks CHIMP is not a dynamically balanced walking robot Instead it is designed to move on stable tanklike treads incorporated into its four limbs When it needs to operate power tools turn valves or otherwise use its arms CHIMP can stand and roll on its leg treads The robots long front arms almost 5 feet give it an apelike appearance CHIMP ranked third in the DARPA Robotics Challenge Trials in December 2013  9   11  Scoring 18 out of a possible 32 points during the twoday trials the team demonstrated the systems ability to perform such tasks as removing debris opening doors cutting a hole in a wall and closing a series of valves The system was selected as one of nine eligible for DARPA funding to prepare for the DARPA Robotics Challenge Finals in 2015  10  Urban challenge  edit  Carnegie Mellon Universitys Tartan Racing team  6  and General Motors built an autonomous SUV that won first place in the 2007 DARPA Urban Challenge  5  The Urban Challenge race was held on November 3 2007 at the Victorville training facility in California Eleven teams competed against each other to finish a 60mile city course in less than six hours Their vehicles had to execute simulated missions in a mock urban area while obeying traffic laws safely merging into moving traffic navigating traffic circles negotiating busy intersections and avoiding other vehicles  all without human intervention Automation and machine learning for agriculture  edit  Vehicle safeguarding  Being able to detect obstacles and terrain hazards significantly increases the safety of both manned and unmanned agricultural vehicles The project uses machine learning techniques to build a robust obstacle detection system that can be easily adapted to different environments and operating conditions NREC integrated its addon perception packages onto a team of three computercontrolled tractors developed by John Deere  These autonomous tractors were used in harvesting operations in a peat bog The robotic peat harvesting team was tested for a full season completing over 100 harvesting missions in a working peat bog Their behavior imitated manual peat harvesting operations while maintaining a safe operating environment Strawberry Plant Sorter  Building upon expertise in vision mechanisms and manipulation NREC built an automated strawberry plant sorter that streamlines the harvesting process improves efficiency and ensures consistent plant quality The machine vision system is trained to sort strawberry plants using samples harvested by a human sorting plants of different varieties and levels of maturity while operating under realistic conditions where rain and frost change plants appearance and roots may contain mud and debris Lassen Canyon Nursery and other growers representing approximately 85 of Californias strawberry plant nursery market supported this project and plan to use the technology in their operations Orchard Spraying  NREC developed a retrofit kit that allows a tractor to operate without a driver Its software accurately estimated the vehicles location and enabled it to autonomously follow a predetermined path The autonomous tractor sprayed water while following a sevenkilometerlong path through an orange orchard without any human intervention To achieve the path teachplayback capability NREC developed a positioning system that uses an extended Kalman filter for fusing the odometry the GPS information and the IMU measurements The path following system is based on the Pure Pursuit algorithm  clarification needed  Defense robotics for convoy safety  edit  NREC and Oshkosh Defense are developing autonomous unmanned ground vehicle technologies for logistics tactical wheeled vehicles used by the US Marine Corps CARGO Unmanned Ground Vehicles CARGO UGVs or CUGVs are designed for autonomous use in convoys that combine manned and unmanned vehicles An operator in another vehicle supervises one or more unmanned vehicles which drive autonomously in convoy formation day and night in all weather and when dust and smoke limit visibility Technologies developed under this project are part of Oshkosh Defenses TerraMax UGV kit which supports unmanned convoy operations  12  Sensabot  edit  Sensabot is a rugged robot designed to safely carry out onsite inspections in hazardous environments isolated facilities and other places that are difficult or dangerous for personnel to access Benefits include reduced risk and improved efficiency of operation The system consists of a mobile robotic base equipped with a sensor boom that is fitted with inspection sensors It is capable of operating in extreme temperatures as well as explosive and toxic atmospheres The

perform revetment operations along the Mississippi River  Once deployed ARMOR 1 will replace the old Mat Sinking Unit originally built in 1948 The goal is to increase the speed of revetment operations and improve the safety and working conditions of the employees who perform this vital work When completed ARMOR 1 will include six independent robotic cranes These cranes will pick up the large concrete squares from the supply barge and place them on the mat deck of ARMOR 1s manufacturing barge There the individual squares will be tied together into one 140 ft wide and up to 900 ft long flexible mat by an automated tie system The completed mat will be launched from the barge and will be submerged along the banks of the Mississippi River while more mats are continuously being assembled on the deck Contribution to education  edit  The Carnegie Mellon Robotics Academy CMRA is an educational outreach of Carnegie Mellon University and part of the universitys worldrenowned Robotics Institute In 2000 CMRAs administrative staff and development team became housed at NRECs facilities The Computer Science STEM Network CS2N is a collaborative research project between Carnegie
