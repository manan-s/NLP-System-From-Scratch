Founder Jaime Carbonell Director Mona Diab Academic staff 33 Location Pittsburgh  Pennsylvania Campus Urban Website www lti cs cmu edu The Language Technologies Institute LTI is a research institute at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh  Pennsylvania  United States  and focuses on the area of language technologies  The institute is home to 33 faculty with the primary scholarly research of the institute focused on machine translation  speech recognition  speech synthesis  information retrieval  parsing  information extraction  and multimodal machine learning  Until 1996 the institute existed as the Center for Machine Translation which was established in 1986 Subsequently from 1996 onwards it started awarding degrees and the name was changed to The Language Technologies Institute The institute was founded by Professor Jaime Carbonell  who served as director until his death in February 2020 He was followed by Jamie Callan and then Carolyn Rosé  as interim directors In August 2023 Mona Diab became the director of the institute Academic programs  edit  The institute currently offers two PhD programs four different types of master degrees and an undergraduate minor  1  The masters programs each offer a different focus or career target The Master of Language Technologies MLT is a researchfocused masters in which students take all the same classes as PhD students and are frequently funded through sponsored research projects In effect this means they work on grants with faculty the same as PhD students so most transition to PhD programs after completion The MLT serves as a bridging masters for students from nontraditional backgrounds or with limited research experience in language technologies In contrast the Master of Science in Intelligent Information Systems MIIS Master of Computational Data Science MCDS and Master of Science in Artificial Intelligence and Innovation MSAII focus more heavily on coursework and projects that prepare students for industry jobs The MIIS and MCDS programs are also targeted at shorter eg 16 month completion times and require an industry internship during the program Faculty  edit  Notable faculty include Alan W Black
