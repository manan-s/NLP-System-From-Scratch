become a financial burden on the city Therefore in September 1949 work began on remodeling the building and it temporarily housed Pitts School of Public Health   7  In October 1957 the Municipal Hospital was formally acquired from the city for 13 million 141 million today and renamed Jonas Salk Hall For a time the upper floors of the building served as a residence for students Pitt remodeled
