these traditions hearken to the universitys strength in engineering such as the buggy races and the mobots while others are purely social in nature such as Spring Carnival and The Fence  1  Alma Mater  edit  Alma Mater  Carnegie Mellon University Song Written 1924  1924  Genre Alma mater Composers J Vick OBrien Lyricists Charles J Taylor The alma mater of Carnegie Mellon University was written by Charles J Taylor and set to music by J Vick OBrien when the university was still named Carnegie Institute of Technology The song was copyrighted by the institute in 1924 While not used as much as alma maters at some other universities its alma mater plays a vital role in the culture and history of Carnegie Mellon University  It is sung at convocation ceremonies of incoming classes commencement ceremonies of graduating classes and other official events such as the investiture of new presidents The universitys Kiltie Band plays it at certain home games The full song has three verses Normally only the first verse is performed Verses  edit  First Verse  edit  The first verse references the history of Pittsburgh Pennsylvania where the university is located In the late18th Century after the United States won its independence the settlement at the present city of Pittsburgh was known as the frontier and the Gateway to the West The verse describes the wilderness through which the westwardbound settlers traversed to reach their goal The verse concludes with the proud allusion that Carnegie Mellon was founded by Andrew Carnegie   2  Here where spangled wildernesses Robed the fountains of the west Where the savage strife and stresses Brought the settlers crimson quest Land of legend glory graces Gypsy tide and toiling shore Mid thy hilltops Alma Mater Stands enthroned forever more All Hail Carnegie Alma Mater Stands enthroned forever more Second Verse  edit  The second verse begins with Pittsburghs role at the nations inception It references the history of the labor movement through the Antebellum Era and Gilded Age  Upon its founding in 1900 Andrew Carnegie had intended the university to be a vocational school for the children of the workers in his steel mills As the university progressed it embraced the arts as exemplified by the Carnegie Mellon School of Drama  the first degreegranting program in the country while continuing to focus on its technical and scientific education  2  The university maintains a strong collaborative culture among its constituent colleges ranging from the arts to the sciences Here was heard the muskets rattle Round us rolld the thralling drum All is hushd no more they startle Now we hear sweet labors hum Art and science rule our battle In their pathway honor lies Hail Carnegie Alma Mater Show the way that truth may rise All Hail Carnegie Alma Mater Show the way that truth may rise Third Verse  edit  The last verse references the universitys dedication to academic excellence and highquality teaching alluding to its continued pursuit of collecting and disseminating knowledge Show the way arouse awaken Bear aloft the beacon bright That our minds be ever taken Unto learning into light Stand in daytimes storm unshaken Guide throstorm of deepest night Hail Carnegie Alma Mater Stand for progress peace and right All Hail Carnegie Alma Mater Stand for progress peace and right The Fence  edit  The Fence 2006 The first great tradition at Carnegie Mellon is The Fence built in 1923 which lies in the middle of the Cut  3  The Fence frequently displays witty or poignant messages but is just as often used to advertise upcoming events or recent accomplishments Because of its highly visible location on campus it is an ideal place to proclaim ones message to as much of the student body as possible The original wooden fence was replaced in 1993 when it collapsed under its own weight due to six inches of surrounding paint At the time it held the Guinness World Record for being the most painted object  3  Today a concrete and steel reinforced fence stands where the original one stood imitating the size it would be today Students still paint the fence in an effort to break the record held by the original as the worlds most painted upon object As of 2017 update the fence has four inches of paint  4  The Fences origins date back to the early days of Carnegie Institute of Technology when The Cut was still a valley that separated the Carnegie Tech buildings from the Margaret Morrison womens school Over the valley spanned a bridge which the men of Carnegie Tech realized was a strategic spot for meeting the women of Maggie Mo as they crossed the cut However when The Cut was filled in to form the currentday grassy field the bottleneck disappeared In its stead the class of 1923 erected a fence to stand in as a meeting spot  5  However the universitys students took a negative view of the structure not understanding the point of it The administration was just about to give up and tear it down when the night before its scheduled removal a fraternity painted The Fence in the middle of the night advertising a party on campus  citation needed   The party turned out to be a huge success as has the tradition of painting the fence The administration relented on their plans for removing the fence In August 2008 the graduating class of 2008 at the Carnegie Mellon Silicon Valley Campus brought the tradition to California by installing their own version of the fence  and dedicating it to Randy Pausch  who died in that year Tradition dictates that The Fence only be painted after midnight and before sunrise and only in its entirety It must be painted by hand using brushes If it is painted with spray paint or rollers the painters would be cited for vandalism  A group wishing to paint the Fence must station two representatives or guards on the small gravel region surrounding it As long as two guards remain within the boundary no other group may take the Fence This sometimes leads to groups setting up a tent or campsite just inside the boundary so that they may hold the fence for an extended amount of time It is also unwritten etiquette that if another group needs the Fence to advertise one of their upcoming events the current holders should turn the Fence over to that group This often leads to extended periods of time when the Fence is passed between groups in an organized fashion Two years of paint layers are visible after the defacing On March 21 2011 six freshman Carnegie Mellon students defaced the fence They were stopped by fellow students CMU Police Officers and representatives from the Office of Student Affairs A hacksaw was used to cut away over two years worth of layers of paint  6   7  The following night hundreds of CMU students helped paint the fence in an effort to heal it  8  Facilities Management Services has taken the responsibility of repairing the fence Instead of gluing it back together the chunks were removed on March 23 leaving dozens of different layers visible The Fence is used not only to advertise upcoming events for a variety of organizations but also to recognize different political views religious or ethnic holidays as well as support those on campus that may feel underrepresented Spring Carnival  edit  Usually held in April Spring Carnival is the biggest event of the Carnegie Mellon school year Students have a fourday weekend to enjoy the Carnival festivities Many students work hard all year to make it a success and the Pittsburgh community is invited to attend Alumni often return for the festivities and Reunion coincides with the weekend Spring Carnival features Midway with all the standard carnival attractions and a Buggy race which is run over the course of the weekend Many organizations across campus construct both a booth for Midway and a buggy for Sweepstakes Judges decide on winners in several different categories Two pushers exchange the buggy for Kappa Delta Rho on the first hill of Sweepstakes Buggy races  edit  Buggy officially called Sweepstakes is a race around Schenley Park  It can be thought of as a relay race with five runners using the buggy vehicle as the baton Entrants submit a small usually torpedoshaped vehicle that is pushed uphill and then allowed to freeroll downhill The driver wholike all participantsmust be a Carnegie Mellon student and is almost always short light and female lies down inside the vehicle with the steering and brake controls The vehicles are completely unpowered including the prohibition of energy storing devices such as flywheels Brakes are required but generally rarely used Often brakes are applied only as a last resort to prevent a crash or to slow the buggy at the finish for the pusher to catch up because the rules specify that the pusher must be in contact with buggy at the finish line or be disqualified Drivers who have been forced to apply the brakes due to another driver cutting them off may appeal for a reroll in another heat without penalty The secondtolast corner of the race a sharp 110degree right turn is affectionately called The Chute and is lined with hay bales to prevent potential driver and spectator injury Speeds can be quite high in the chute often in the vicinity of 35 mph Student Dormitory Council SDC  9  holds the current mens record of 20216 and the current womens record of 22327 both set in 2017  10  For many years extensive experimentation and innovation evolved buggy designs Prior to 1980 the primary format used 4 wheels in a symmetrical layout with respect to the direction of travel Exceptions to this did occur with both 3wheeled buggies  11  and 2wheeled bikes  12  being entered on occasion Since 1980 new materials braking systems and wheel orientations provided significant opportunity for experimentation Alignment of wheels received particular attention The first successful 3 wheeled buggies were developed in the early 80s led by Pi Kappa Alpha PiKA and Sigma Nu Development of two wheeled buggies  13  by Delta Upsilon from 19861989 continued the theme of wheel alignment In 1988 Delta Upsilon  14  broke the course record with a time of 2085  15   a record that stood only briefly as SPIRIT surpassed that time later that day and further lowered the record time the following day Two wheeled buggies were later eliminated from competition for safety reasons through modifications to the rules PiKA and SPIRIT took every Sweepstakes championship from 1986 until 2000 when SDC won the womens race and 2001 when Fringe won the mens race PiKA continued its success in the 2000s setting the consecutive wins record by winning for seven years in a row 20022008 SDC took the title in the mens race in 2009 breaking PiKAs streak and setting a new record Fringe took the mens title in 2010 after a dominant SDC was removed from competition due to an alleged fire safety violation Fringe took the mens title again in 2011 in beating SDC A by 1 second with SDC B and C teams taking 3rd and 4th while SDC reclaimed the Womens title  16  The defending mens champion is SDC with eight consecutive wins from 2012 through 2019 which is the record for most wins in a row The current womens title is also held by SDC 2017 2018 and 2019 Live media coverage of the Sweepstakes races has historically been provided by WRCTFM  the schools studentrun radio station In recent years campus television station cmuTV has broadcast live video coverage of the races with commentary from WRCTFM In the fall of 2008 the Buggy Alumni Association  17  was founded to preserve the history of the sport assist with keeping alumni connected to the event and assist the current students in maintaining the races continuing existence The race videos are available on DVD from cmuTV after the races end Midway  edit  A booth in Carnegie Mellon Universitys 2013 Booth Competition a part of the spring Carnival For Carnival Weekend the College of Fine Arts parking lot is turned into Midway Midway features both booths and carnival rides Booths are multistory structures constructed by campus organizations featuring usually free games and cheap giveaway prizes The booths are intricate multilevel affairs showing off the creativity and energy of the students who construct them The Friday of the week before Carnival is known as Move On and is when all the organizations who are building booths move their supplies materials tools and prefabricated components onto Midway Build week commences from that Friday night and for the entire week organizations steadfastly build their booths preparing for the official opening of Midway at 300 pm the following Thursday Each year an overall theme for booths is chosen Booth has four competitive categories These include fraternity sorority independent and blitz smaller booths Each organization chooses a subtheme and builds their booth accordingly The construction of these booths is a competition and each booth is judged on various criteria including both daytime and nighttime appearance adherence to theme game playability environmentalism and appropriateness of prizes Midway also features portable carnival rides that are brought in and set up along with standard carnival concession food Various musical acts improv comedy troupes and other performances are staged in a nearby tent running throughout the weekend and providing a backdrop to the entire spectacle Mobot  edit  A mobot approaches the end of the course with Hamerschlag Hall in the background Mobot a general term resulting from shortening mobile robot is an annual competition at Carnegie Mellon that made its debut in 1994 In this event robots try autonomously to pass through gates in order and reach the finish line There is a white line on the pavement connecting the gates and the line is normally used to find the gates though it is not mandated by the rules that the robots follow the line Towards the end of the course the lines split and merge randomly and knowledge of which line leads to the next gate is needed to consistently finish the course This information is provided by the judges shortly before the actual competition begins The current undergraduate mobot course record of 11710 is held by Nathaniel Barshay for his entry AEPi which competed in 2010 The overall mobot course record of 3399 seconds is held by a Michael Licitra and Jeff McMahill set in 2009 In Carnival fashion awards are presented to overall winners The rewards are as follows First Place 1000 Second Place 500 Third Place 250 Open Class 250 Judges Choice 100 Course Record 250 and MoboJoust 100  18  Entry to compete in the Mobot competition is free and is for currently enrolled undergraduate students at Carnegie Mellon The Mobot Competition is run and organized by the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University Kiltie Band  edit  The Kiltie Band is the concert and marching band of Carnegie Mellon University  Pittsburgh  Pennsylvania  United States It is known for wearing kilts  in recognition of the ScottishAmerican ancestry of Andrew Carnegie  the founder of the university As of 2021 the bands director
