Scotland Andrew Carnegie was born to Margaret Morrison Carnegie and William Carnegie in Dunfermline  Scotland  10  in a typical weavers cottage with only one main room It consisted of half the ground floor which was shared with the neighboring weavers family  11  The main room served as a living room dining room and bedroom  11  He was named after his paternal grandfather  11  William Carnegie had a successful weaving business and owned multiple looms  10  In 1836 the family moved to a larger house in Edgar Street opposite Reids Park following the demand for more heavy damask  from which his father benefited  11  Carnegie was educated at the Free School in Dunfermline a gift to the town from philanthropist Adam Rolland of Gask  12  Carnegies maternal uncle Scottish political leader George Lauder Sr  deeply influenced him as a boy by introducing him to Robert Burns  writings  13  and historical Scottish heroes such as Robert the Bruce  William Wallace  and Rob Roy  Lauders son also named George Lauder  grew up with Carnegie and later became his business partner in the United States  14  When Carnegie was 12 his father had fallen on tough times as a handloom weaver Making matters worse the country was in starvation His mother helped support the family by assisting her brother and by selling potted meats at her sweetie shop becoming the primary breadwinner  15  Struggling to make ends meet the Carnegies decided to borrow money from George Lauder Sr  16  and move to the United States in 1848 for the prospect of a better life They headed to Allegheny Pennsylvania  where they heard there was a demand for workers  17  Carnegies emigration to America was his second journey outside Dunfermline The first was a family outing to Edinburgh to see Queen Victoria   18  In September 1848 Carnegie and his family arrived in Allegheny Carnegies father struggled to sell his product on his own  19  Eventually the father and son both received job offers at Anchor Cotton Mills a Scottishowned facility Carnegies first job in 1848 was as a bobbin boy  changing spools of thread in a cotton mill 12 hours a day 6 days a week in a Pittsburgh cotton factory His starting wage was 120 per week 42 by 2023 inflation  20  His father soon quit his position at the cotton mill returning to his loom and was again removed as a substantial breadwinner  21  But Carnegie attracted the attention of John Hay a Scottish manufacturer of bobbins who offered him a job for 200 per week 70 by 2023 inflation  22  In his autobiography Carnegie writes about the hardships he had to endure with this new job Soon after this Mr John Hay a fellow Scotch manufacturer of bobbins in Allegheny City needed a boy and asked whether I would not go into his service I went and received two dollars per week but at first the work was even more irksome than the factory I had to run a small steamengine and to fire the boiler in the cellar of the bobbin factory It was too much for me I found myself night after night sitting up in bed trying the steam gauges fearing at one time that the steam was too low and that the workers above would complain that they had not power enough and at another time that the steam was too high and that the boiler might burst  23  Telegraph Carnegie age 16 with younger brother Thomas c 1851 In 1849  24  Carnegie became a telegraph messenger boy in the Pittsburgh Office of the Ohio Telegraph Company at 250 per week 92 by 2023 inflation  25  following the recommendation of his uncle He was a hard worker and would memorize all of the locations of Pittsburghs businesses and the faces of important men He made many connections this way He also paid close attention to his work and quickly learned to distinguish the different sounds the incoming telegraph signals produced He developed the ability to translate signals by ear without using the paper slip  26  Within a year he was promoted to an operator Carnegies education and passion for reading were given a boost by Colonel James Anderson  who opened his personal library of 400 volumes to working boys each Saturday night  27  Carnegie was a consistent borrower and a  selfmade man  in both his economic development and his intellectual and cultural development He was so grateful to Colonel Anderson for the use of his library that he resolved if ever wealth came to me to see to it that other poor boys might receive opportunities similar to those for which we were indebted to the nobleman  28  His capacity his willingness for hard work his perseverance and his alertness soon brought him opportunities Railroads Starting in 1853 when Carnegie was around 18 years old Thomas A Scott of the Pennsylvania Railroad employed him as a secretarytelegraph operator at a salary of 400 per week 146 by 2023 inflation Carnegie accepted the job with the railroad as he saw more prospects for career growth and experience there than with the telegraph company  15  When Carnegie was 24 years old Scott asked him if he could handle being superintendent of the Western Division of the Pennsylvania Railroad  29  On December 1 1859 Carnegie officially became superintendent of the Western Division He hired his sixteenyearold brother Tom to be his personal secretary and telegraph operator Carnegie also hired his cousin Maria Hogan who became the first female telegraph operator in the country  30  As superintendent Carnegie made a salary of 1500 a year 51000 by 2023 inflation  29  His employment by the Pennsylvania Railroad would be vital to his later success The railroads were the first big businesses in America and the Pennsylvania was one of the largest Carnegie learned much about management and cost control during these years and from Scott in particular  15  18601865 American Civil War Pullman sleeping car where Carnegie made one of his most successful investments Before the American Civil War  Carnegie arranged a merger between Woodruffs company and that of George Pullman  the inventor of the sleeping car for firstclass travel  which facilitated business travel at distances over 500 miles 800 km The investment proved a success and a source of profit for Woodruff and Carnegie The young Carnegie continued to work for Pennsylvanias Tom Scott and introduced several improvements in the service  31  In the spring of 1861 Carnegie was appointed by Scott who was now Assistant Secretary of War in charge of military transportation as Superintendent of the Military Railways and the Union Governments telegraph lines in the East Carnegie helped open the rail lines into Washington DC that the rebels had cut he rode the locomotive pulling the first brigade of Union troops to reach Washington DC Following the defeat of Union forces at Bull Run  he personally supervised the transportation of the defeated forces Under his organization the telegraph service rendered efficient service to the Union cause and significantly assisted in the eventual victory Carnegie later joked that he was the first casualty of the war when he gained a scar on his cheek from freeing a trapped telegraph wire  32  The defeat of the Confederacy required vast supplies of munitions  railroads and telegraph lines to deliver the goods The war demonstrated how integral the industries were to Union success  33  Keystone Bridge Company Eads Bridge across the Mississippi River  opened in 1874 using Carnegie steel In 1864 Carnegie was one of the early investors in the Columbia Oil Company in Venango County Pennsylvania   34  In one year the firm yielded over 1 million in cash dividends and petroleum from oil wells on the property sold profitably The demand for iron products such as armor for gunboats cannons and shells as well as a hundred other industrial products made Pittsburgh a center of wartime production Carnegie worked with others in establishing a steel rolling mill  and steel production and control of industry became the source of his fortune Carnegie had some investments in the iron industry before the war After the war Carnegie left the railroads to devote his energies to the ironworks trade Carnegie worked to develop several ironworks eventually forming the Keystone Bridge Works and the Union Ironworks in Pittsburgh Although he had left the Pennsylvania Railroad Company he remained connected to its management namely Thomas A Scott and J Edgar Thomson He used his connection to the two men to acquire contracts for his Keystone Bridge Company and the rails produced by his ironworks  He also gave stock in his businesses to Scott and Thomson and the Pennsylvania was his best customer When he built his first steel plant he made a point of naming it after Thomson As well as having good business sense Carnegie possessed charm and literary knowledge He was invited to many important social functions which Carnegie exploited to his advantage  35  Carnegie through Keystone supplied the steel for and owned shares in the landmark Eads Bridge project across the Mississippi River at St Louis  Missouri completed 1874 This project was an important proofofconcept for steel technology which marked the opening of a new steel market Carnegie c 1878 Carnegie believed in using his fortune for others and doing more than making money He wrote I propose to take an income no greater than 50000 per annum Beyond this I need ever earn make no effort to increase my fortune but spend the surplus each year for benevolent purposes Let us cast aside business forever except for others Let us settle in Oxford and I shall get a thorough education making the acquaintance of literary men I figure that this will take three years active work I shall pay especial attention to speaking in public We can settle in London and I can purchase a controlling interest in some newspaper or live review and give the general management of it attention taking part in public matters especially those connected with education and improvement of the poorer classes Man must have no idol and the amassing of wealth is one of the worst species of idolatry  No idol is more debasing than the worship of money Whatever I engage in I must push inordinately therefore should I be careful to choose that life which will be the most elevating in its character To continue much longer overwhelmed by business cares and with most of my thoughts wholly upon the way to make more money in the shortest time must degrade me beyond hope of permanent recovery I will resign business at thirtyfive but during these ensuing two years I wish to spend the afternoons in receiving instruction and in reading systematically Industrialist 18751900 Steel empire Bessemer converter The Edgar Thomson Steel Works and BlastFurnaces in Braddock Pennsylvania 1891 Carnegie made his fortune in the steel industry controlling the most extensive integrated iron and steel operations ever owned by an individual in the United States One of his two great innovations was in the cheap and efficient mass production of steel by adopting and adapting the Bessemer process  which allowed the high carbon content of pig iron to be burnt away in a controlled and rapid way during steel production  Steel prices dropped as a result and Bessemer steel was rapidly adopted for rails however it was not suitable for buildings and bridges  36  The second was in his vertical integration of all suppliers of raw materials In 1883 Carnegie bought the rival Homestead Steel Works  which included an extensive plant served by tributary coal and iron fields a 425milelong 684 km railway and a line of lake steamships   31  In the late 1880s Carnegie Steel was the largest manufacturer of pig iron steel rails and coke in the world with a capacity to produce approximately 2000 tons of pig iron per day By 1889 the US output of steel exceeded that of the UK and Carnegie owned a large part of it Carnegies empire grew to include the J Edgar Thomson Steel Works in Braddock named for John Edgar Thomson  Carnegies former boss and president of the Pennsylvania Railroad the Pittsburgh Bessemer Steel Works the Lucy Furnaces  the Union Iron Mills the Union Mill Wilson Walker  County the Keystone Bridge Works the Hartman Steel Works the Frick Coke Company and the Scotia ore mines Carnegie combined his assets and those of his associates in 1892 with the launching of the Carnegie Steel Company   37  Carnegies success was also due to his relationship with the railroad industries which not only relied on steel for track but were also making money from steel transport The steel and railroad barons worked closely to negotiate prices instead of allowing freemarket competition  38  Besides Carnegies market manipulation United States trade tariffs were also working in favor of the steel industry Carnegie spent energy and resources lobbying Congress for a continuation of favorable tariffs from which he earned millions of dollars a year  39  Carnegie tried to keep this information concealed but legal documents released in 1900 during proceedings with the exchairman of Carnegie Steel Henry Clay Frick  revealed how favorable the tariffs had been  40  1901 US Steel In 1901 Carnegie was 65 years of age and considering retirement He reformed his enterprises into conventional joint stock corporations as preparation for this John Pierpont Morgan was a banker and Americas most important financial deal maker He had observed how efficiently Carnegie produced profits He envisioned an integrated steel industry that would cut costs lower prices to consumers produce in greater quantities and raise wages to workers To this end he needed to buy out Carnegie and several other major producers and integrate them into one company thereby eliminating duplication and waste He concluded negotiations on March 2 1901 and formed the United States Steel Corporation  It was the first corporation in the world with a market capitalization of over 1 billion The buyout secretly negotiated by Charles M Schwab no relation to Charles R Schwab  was the largest such industrial takeover in United States history to date The holdings were incorporated in the United States Steel Corporation a trust organized by Morgan and Carnegie retired from business  31  His steel enterprises were bought out for 303450000  8  Carnegies share of this amounted to 22564 million in 2023 826 billion which was paid to him in the form of 5 50year gold bonds The letter agreeing to sell his share was signed on February 26 1901 On March 2 the circular formally filed the organization and capitalization at 14 billion4 of the US gross domestic product at the time of the United States Steel Corporation actually completed the contract The bonds were to be delivered within two weeks to the Hudson Trust Company of Hoboken New Jersey  in trust to Robert A Franks Carnegies business secretary There a special vault was built to house the physical bulk of nearly 230 million worth of bonds  41  Scholar and activist 18801900 Carnegie continued his business career some of his literary intentions were fulfilled He befriended the English poet Matthew Arnold  the English philosopher Herbert Spencer  and the American humorist Mark Twain  as well as being in correspondence and acquaintance with most of the US Presidents   42  statesmen and notable writers  43  Carnegie constructed commodious swimmingbaths for the people of his hometown in Dunfermline in 1879 In the following year Carnegie gave 8000 for the establishment of a Dunfermline Carnegie Library in Scotland In 1884 he gave 50000 to Bellevue Hospital Medical College now part of New York University Medical Center  to create a histological laboratory now called the Carnegie Laboratory In 1881 Carnegie took his family including his 70yearold mother on a trip to the United Kingdom They toured Scotland by coach and enjoyed several receptions en route The highlight was a return to Dunfermline where Carnegies mother laid the foundation stone of a Carnegie Library which he funded Carnegies criticism of British society did not mean dislike on the contrary one of Carnegies ambitions was to act as a catalyst for a close association between Englishspeaking peoples To this end in the early 1880s in partnership with Samuel Storey  he purchased numerous newspapers in Britain all of which were to advocate the abolition of the monarchy and the establishment of the British Republic Carnegies charm aided by his wealth afforded him many British friends including Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone  In 1886 Carnegies younger brother Thomas died at age 43 While owning steel works Carnegie had purchased at low cost the most valuable of the iron ore fields around Lake Superior  Following his tour of the UK he wrote about his experiences in a book entitled An American Fourinhand in Britain  In 1886 Carnegie wrote his most radical work to date entitled Triumphant Democracy  Liberal in its use of statistics to make its arguments the book argued his view that the American republican system of government was superior to the British monarchical system It gave a highly favorable and idealized view of American progress and criticized the British royal family The cover depicted an upended royal crown and a broken scepter The book created considerable controversy in the UK The book made many Americans appreciate their countrys economic progress and sold over 40000 copies mostly in the US Carnegie right with James Bryce 1st Viscount Bryce Although actively involved in running his many businesses Carnegie had become a regular contributor to numerous magazines most notably The Nineteenth Century  under the editorship of James Knowles  and the influential North American Review  led by the editor Lloyd Bryce  In 1889 Carnegie published Wealth in the June issue of the North American Review   44  After reading it Gladstone requested its publication in Britain where it appeared as The Gospel of Wealth in The Pall Mall Gazette  Carnegie argued that the life of a wealthy industrialist should comprise two parts The first part was the gathering and the accumulation of wealth The second part was for the subsequent distribution of this wealth to benevolent causes Philanthropy was key to making life worthwhile Carnegie was a wellregarded writer He published three books on travel  45  Antiimperialism In the aftermath of the SpanishAmerican War  the United States seemed poised to annex Cuba  Guam  Puerto Rico and the Philippines  Carnegie strongly opposed the idea of American colonies He opposed the annexation of the Philippines almost to the point of supporting William Jennings Bryan against McKinley in 1900 In 1898 Carnegie tried to arrange independence for the Philippines As the conclusion of the SpanishAmerican War neared the United States purchased the Philippines from Spain for 20 million To counter what he perceived as American imperialism  Carnegie personally offered 20 million to the Philippines so that the Filipino people could purchase their independence from the United States  46  However nothing came of the offer In 1898 Carnegie joined the American AntiImperialist League  in opposition to the US annexation of the Philippines Its membership included former presidents of the United States Grover Cleveland and Benjamin Harrison and literary figures such as Mark Twain   47   48  19011919 Philanthropist Main articles Carnegie library  Carnegie Corporation of New York  Carnegie Endowment for International Peace  Carnegie

Carnegie Hall  Tuskegee Institute  and Hooker telescope Andrew Carnegies philanthropy Puck magazine cartoon by Louis Dalrymple 1903 Carnegie spent his last years as a philanthropist From 1901 forward public attention was turned from the shrewd business acumen which had enabled Carnegie to accumulate such a fortune to the publicspirited way in which he devoted himself to using it on philanthropic projects He had written about his views on social subjects and the responsibilities of great wealth in Triumphant Democracy 1886 and Gospel of Wealth 1889 Carnegie devoted the rest of his life to providing capital for purposes of public interest and social and educational advancement He saved letters of appreciation from those he helped in a desk drawer labeled Gratitude and Sweet Words He provided 25000 a year to the movement for spelling reform   49  His organization the Simplified Spelling Board   50  created the Handbook of Simplified Spelling  which was written wholly in reformed spelling  51   52  3000 public libraries Captioned Free Libraries Carnegie caricatured by  Spy  for the London magazine Vanity Fair  1903 Among his many philanthropic efforts the establishment of public libraries throughout the United States Britain Canada New Zealand and mostly other Englishspeaking countries was especially prominent In this special driving interest of his Carnegie was inspired by meetings with philanthropist Enoch Pratt 18081896 The Enoch Pratt Free Library 1886 of Baltimore Maryland  impressed Carnegie deeply he said Pratt was my guide and inspiration  53  Carnegie turned over management of the library project by 1908 to his staff led by James Bertram 18741934  54  The first Carnegie Library opened in 1883 in Dunfermline His method was to provide funds to build and equip the library but only on the condition that the local authority matched that by providing the land and a budget for operation and maintenance  55  To secure local interest in 1885 he gave 500000 to Pittsburgh Pennsylvania  for a public library in 1886 he gave 250000 to Allegheny City Pennsylvania  for a music hall and library and he gave 250000 to Edinburgh for a free library In total Carnegie funded some 3000 libraries located in 47 US states and also in Canada Britain Ireland Belgium Serbia France Australia New Zealand South Africa the West Indies  and Fiji  He also donated 50000 to help set up the University of Birmingham in 1899  56  As Van Slyck 1991 showed during the last years of the 19th century there was the increasing adoption of the idea that free libraries should be available to the American public But the design of such libraries was the subject of prolonged and heated debate On one hand the library profession called for designs that supported efficiency in administration and operation on the other wealthy philanthropists favored buildings that reinforced the paternalistic metaphor and enhanced civic pride Between 1886 and 1917 Carnegie reformed both library philanthropy and library design encouraging a closer correspondence between the two  57  Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh  Pittsburgh Pennsylvania Carnegie library  Macomb Illinois

Pittsburgh and the same amount in 1902 to create the Carnegie Institution at Washington DC to encourage research and discovery He later contributed more to these and other schools  55  CIT is now known as Carnegie Mellon University after it merged with the Mellon Institute of Industrial Research  Carnegie also served on the Boards of Cornell University and Stevens Institute of Technology   58  In 1911 Carnegie became a sympathetic benefactor to George Ellery Hale  who was trying to build the 100inch 25 m Hooker Telescope at Mount Wilson  and donated an additional ten million dollars to the Carnegie Institution with the following suggestion to expedite the construction of the telescope I hope the work at Mount Wilson will be vigorously pushed because I am so anxious to hear the expected results from it I should like to be satisfied before I depart that we are going to repay to the old land some part of the debt we owe them by revealing more clearly than ever to them the new heavens The telescope saw first light on November 2 1917 with Carnegie still alive  59  Pittencrieff Park Dunfermline  Scotland In 1901 in Scotland he gave 10 million to establish the Carnegie Trust for the Universities of Scotland  It was created by a deed that he signed on June 7 1901 and it was incorporated by royal charter on August 21 1902 The establishing gift of 10 million was then an unprecedented sum at the time total government assistance to all four Scottish universities was about 50000 a year The aim of the Trust was to improve and extend the opportunities for scientific research in the Scottish universities and to enable the deserving and qualified youth of Scotland to attend a university  60  He was subsequently elected Lord Rector of University of St Andrews in December 1901  61  and formally installed as such in October 1902  62  serving until 1907 He also donated large sums of money to Dunfermline the place of his birth In addition to a library Carnegie also bought the private estate which became Pittencrieff Park and opened it to all members of the public establishing the Carnegie Dunfermline Trust  63  to benefit the people of Dunfermline A statue of Carnegie was later built between 1913 and 1914 in the park as a commemoration for his creation of the park  64   65   66  Carnegie was a major patron of music He was a founding financial backer of Jeannette Thurber s National Conservatory of Music of America in 1885  67  He built the music performing venue Carnegie Hall in New York City it opened in 1891 and remained in his family until 1925 His interest in music led him to fund the construction of 7000 pipe organs in churches and temples with no apparent preference for any religious denomination or sect  68   69  He gave a further 10 million in 1913 to endow the Carnegie United Kingdom Trust  a grantmaking foundation  70   71  He transferred to the trust the charge of all his existing and future benefactions other than university benefactions in the United Kingdom He gave the trustees a wide discretion and they inaugurated a policy of financing rural library schemes rather than erecting library buildings and of assisting the musical education of the people rather than granting organs to churches  72  Carnegie with Black American leader Booker T Washington front row center in 1906 while visiting Tuskegee Institute The Peace Palace in the Hague opened in 1913 In 1901 Carnegie also established large pension funds for his former employees at Homestead and in 1905 for American college professors  31  The latter fund evolved into TIAACREF  One critical requirement was that churchrelated schools had to sever their religious connections to get his money Carnegie was a large benefactor of the Tuskegee Institute for Black American education under Booker T Washington  He helped Washington create the National Negro Business League  Dutch medal of the Carnegie Hero Fund In 1904 he founded the Carnegie Hero Fund for the United States and Canada a few years later also established in the United Kingdom Switzerland Norway Sweden France Italy the Netherlands Belgium Denmark and Germany for the recognition of deeds of heroism Carnegie contributed 15 million in 1903 for the erection of the Peace Palace at The Hague  and he donated 150000 for a PanAmerican Palace in Washington as a home for the International Bureau of American Republics  31  When it became obvious that Carnegie could not give away his entire fortune within his lifetime he established the Carnegie Corporation of New York in 1911 to promote the advancement and diffusion of knowledge and understanding and continue his program of giving Carnegie was honored for his philanthropy and support of the arts by initiation as an honorary member of Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia fraternity on October 14 1917 at the New England Conservatory of Music in Boston Massachusetts The fraternitys mission reflects Carnegies values by developing young men to share their talents to create harmony in the world Death Carnegies grave at Sleepy Hollow Cemetery in Sleepy Hollow New York Carnegie died on August 11 1919 in Lenox Massachusetts  at his Shadow Brook estate of Bronchial Pneumonia   73   74  He had already given away 350695653 approximately US598 billion in 2023 dollars  75  of his wealth After his death his last 30 million was given to foundations charities and to pensioners  76  He was buried at Sleepy Hollow Cemetery in Sleepy Hollow New York  The grave site is located on the Arcadia Hebron plot of land at the corner of Summit Avenue and Dingle Road Carnegie is buried only a few yards away from union organizer Samuel Gompers  another important figure of industry in the Gilded Age   77  Controversies 1889 Johnstown Flood Main article Johnstown Flood A contemporary rendition of the Johnstown Flood scene at the Stone Bridge by Kurz and Allison 1890 Carnegie was one of more than 50 members of the South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club  which has been blamed for the Johnstown Flood that killed 2209 people in 1889  78  At the suggestion of his friend Benjamin Ruff Carnegies partner Henry Clay Frick had formed the exclusive South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club high above Johnstown Pennsylvania The sixtyodd club members were the leading business tycoons of Western Pennsylvania and included among their number Fricks best friend Andrew Mellon  his attorneys Philander Knox and James Hay Reed as well as Fricks business partner Carnegie High above the city near the small town of South Fork the South Fork Dam was originally built between 1838 and 1853 by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania as part of a canal system to be used as a reservoir for a canal basin in Johnstown With the comingofage of railroads superseding canal barge transport the lake was abandoned by the Commonwealth sold to the Pennsylvania Railroad and sold again to private interests and eventually came to be owned by the South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club in 1881 Prior to the flood speculators had purchased the abandoned reservoir made less than wellengineered repairs to the old dam raised the lake level built cottages and a clubhouse and created the South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club Less than 20 miles 32 km downstream from the dam sat the city of Johnstown The dam was 72 feet 22 m high and 931 feet 284 m long Between 1881 when the club was opened and 1889 the dam frequently sprang leaks and was patched mostly with mud and straw Additionally a previous owner removed and sold for scrap the three cast iron discharge pipes that previously allowed a controlled release of water There had been some speculation as to the dams integrity and concerns had been raised by the head of the Cambria Iron Works downstream in Johnstown Such repair work a reduction in height and unusually high snowmelt and heavy spring rains combined to cause the dam to give way on May 31 1889 resulting in twenty million tons of water sweeping down the valley as the Johnstown Flood  79  When word of the dams failure was telegraphed to Pittsburgh Frick and other members of the South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club gathered to form the Pittsburgh Relief Committee for assistance to the flood victims as well as determining never to speak publicly about the club or the flood This strategy was a success and Knox and Reed were able to fend off all lawsuits that would have placed blame upon the clubs members Although Cambria Iron and Steels facilities were heavily damaged by the flood they returned to full production within a year After the flood Carnegie built Johnstown a new library to replace the one built by Cambrias chief legal counsel Cyrus Elder which was destroyed in the flood The Carnegiedonated library is now owned by the Johnstown Area Heritage Association and houses the Flood Museum 1892 Homestead Strike The Homestead Strike Main article Homestead Strike The Homestead Strike was a bloody labor confrontation lasting 143 days in 1892 one of the most serious in US history The conflict was centered on Carnegie Steels main plant in Homestead Pennsylvania  and grew out of a labor dispute between the Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers AA and the Carnegie Steel Company  Carnegie left on a trip to Scotland before the unrest peaked  80  In doing so Carnegie left mediation of the dispute in the hands of his associate and partner Henry Clay Frick  Frick was well known in industrial circles for maintaining staunch antiunion sentiment With the collective bargaining agreement between the union and company expiring at the end of June Frick and the leaders of the local AA union entered into negotiations in February With the steel industry doing well and prices higher the AA asked for a wage increase the AA represented about 800 of the 3800 workers at the plant Frick immediately countered with an average 22 wage decrease that would affect nearly half the unions membership and remove a number of positions from the bargaining unit  81  Fricks letter to Carnegie describing the plans and munitions that will be on the barges when the Pinkertons arrive to confront the strikers in Homestead The union and company failed to come to an agreement and management locked the union out Workers considered the stoppage a  lockout  by management and not a strike by workers As such the workers would have been well within their rights to protest and subsequent government action would have been a set of criminal procedures designed to crush what was seen as a pivotal demonstration of the growing labor rights movement  strongly opposed by management Frick brought in thousands of strikebreakers to work the steel mills and Pinkerton agents to safeguard them On July 6 the arrival of a force of 300 Pinkerton agents from New York City and Chicago resulted in a fight in which 10 men  seven strikers and three Pinkertons  were killed and hundreds were injured Pennsylvania Governor Robert Pattison ordered two brigades of the state militia to the strike site Then allegedly in response to the fight between the striking workers and the Pinkertons anarchist Alexander Berkman shot at Frick in an attempted assassination wounding him While not directly connected to the strike Berkman was tied in for the assassination attempt According to Berkman  with the elimination of Frick responsibility for Homestead conditions would rest with Carnegie  82  Afterwards the company successfully resumed operations with nonunion immigrant employees in place of the Homestead plant workers and Carnegie returned to the United States  80  However Carnegies reputation was permanently damaged by the Homestead events Theodore Roosevelt According to David Nasaw after 1898 when the United States entered a war with Spain Carnegie increasingly devoted his energy to supporting pacifism He strongly opposed the war and the subsequent imperialistic American takeover of the Philippines When Theodore Roosevelt became president in 1901 Carnegie and Roosevelt were in frequent contact They exchanged letters communicated through mutual friends such as Secretary of State John Hay  and met in person Carnegie hoped that Roosevelt would turn the Philippines free not realizing he was more of an imperialist and believer in warrior virtues than President McKinley had been He saluted Roosevelt for forcing Germany and Britain to arbitrate their conflict with Venezuela in 1903 and especially for becoming the mediator who negotiated an end to the war between Russia and Japan in 19071908 Roosevelt relied on Carnegie for financing his expedition to Africa in 1909  In return he asked the expresident to mediate the growing conflict between the cousins who ruled Britain and Germany Roosevelt started to do so but the scheme collapsed when king Edward VII suddenly died  83   84  Nasaw argues that Roosevelt systematically deceived and manipulated Carnegie and held the elderly man in contempt Nasaw quotes a private letter Roosevelt wrote to Whitelaw Reid in 1905  85  I have tried hard to like Carnegie but it is pretty difficult There is no type of man for whom I feel a more contemptuous abhorrence than for the one who makes a God of mere moneymaking and at the same time is always yelling out that kind of utterly stupid condemnation of war which in almost every case springs from a combination of defective physical courage of unmanly shrinking from pain and effort and of hopelessly twisted ideals All the suffering from Spanish war comes far short of the suffering preventable and nonpreventable among the operators of the Carnegie steel works and among the small investors during the time that Carnegie was making his fortune It is as noxious folly to denounce war per se as it is to denounce business per se Unrighteous war is a hideous evil but I am not at all sure that it is worse evil than business unrighteousness Personal life Family Andrew Carnegie with his wife Louise Whitfield Carnegie and their daughter Margaret Carnegie Miller in 1910 Carnegie did not want to marry during his mothers lifetime instead choosing to take care of her in her illness towards the end of her life  86  After she died in 1886 the 51yearold Carnegie married Louise Whitfield   86  who was 21 years his junior  87  In 1897  88  the couple had their only child Margaret  whom they named after Carnegies mother  89  Residences The Andrew Carnegie Mansion  located on 5th Avenue in the Upper East Side  Manhattan New York Carnegie bought Skibo Castle in Scotland  90  and made his home partly there and partly in his New York mansion located at 2 East 91st Street at Fifth Avenue   31  The building was completed in late 1902 and he lived there until his death in 1919 His wife Louise continued to live there until her death in 1946 The building has been used since 1976 as the CooperHewitt Smithsonian Design Museum  part of the Smithsonian Institution  The surrounding neighborhood on Manhattans Upper East Side has come to be called Carnegie Hill  The mansion was designated as a National Historic Landmark in 1966  91   92   93  Philosophy Politics Carnegie gave formal allegiance to the Republican Party though he was said to be a violent opponent of some of the most sacred doctrines of the party  94  Andrew Carnegie Dictum In his final days Carnegie had pneumonia Before his death on August 11 1919 Carnegie had donated 350695654 for various causes The Andrew Carnegie Dictum was To spend the first third of ones life getting all the education one can To spend the next third making all the money one can To spend the last third giving it all away for worthwhile causes Carnegie was involved in philanthropic causes but he kept himself away from religious circles He wanted to be identified by the world as a  positivist  He was highly influenced in public life by John Bright  On wealth Carnegie at Skibo Castle 1914 Andrew Carnegie by Charles McBride  Edinburgh Central Library As early as 1868 at age 33 he drafted a memo to himself He wrote  The amassing of wealth is one of the worse species of idolatry No idol more debasing than the worship of money  95  In order to avoid degrading himself he wrote in the same memo he would retire at age 35 to pursue the practice of philanthropic giving for  the man who dies thus rich dies disgraced However he did not begin his philanthropic work in all earnest until 1881 at age 46 with the gift of a library to his hometown of Dunfermline Scotland  96  Carnegie wrote  The Gospel of Wealth   97  an article in which he stated his belief that the rich should use their wealth to help enrich society In that article Carnegie also expressed sympathy for the ideas of progressive taxation and an estate tax  The growing disposition to tax more and more heavily large estates left at death is a cheering indication of the growth of a salutary change in public opinion The State of Pennsylvania now takessubject to some exceptionsonetenth of the property left by its citizens The budget presented in the British Parliament the other day proposes to increase the death duties and most significant of all the new tax is to be a graduated one Of all forms of taxation this seems the wisest Men who continue hoarding great sums all their lives the proper use of which for public ends would work good to the community from which it chiefly came should be made to feel that the community in the form of the State cannot thus be deprived of its proper share By taxing estates heavily at death the State marks its condemnation of the selfish millionaires unworthy life  98   99  The following is taken from one of Carnegies memos to himself Man does not live by bread alone I have known millionaires starving for lack of the nutriment which alone can sustain all that is human in man and I know workmen and many socalled poor men who revel in luxuries beyond the power of those millionaires to reach It is the mind that makes the body rich There is no class so pitiably wretched as that which possesses money and nothing else Money can only be the useful drudge of things immeasurably higher than itself Exalted beyond this as it sometimes is it remains Caliban still and still plays the beast My aspirations take a higher flight Mine be it to have contributed to the enlightenment and the joys of the mind to the things of the spirit to all that tends to bring into the lives of the toilers of Pittsburgh sweetness and light I hold this the noblest possible use of wealth  100  Intellectual influences Herbert Spencer evolutionary thought Carnegie claimed to be a champion of evolutionary thoughtparticularly the work of Herbert Spencer  even declaring Spencer his teacher  101   I came fortunately upon Darwins and Spencers works The Data of Ethics First Principles Social Statics The Descent of Man Reaching the pages which explain how man has absorbed such mental foods as were favorable to him retaining what was salutary rejecting what was deleterious I remember that light came as in a flood and all was clear Not only had I got rid of theology and the supernatural but I had found the truth of evolution All is well since all grows better became my motto my true source of comfort Man was not created with an instinct for his own degradation but from the lower he had risen to the higher forms Nor is there any conceivable end to his march to perfection His face is turned to the light he stands in the sun and looks upward  102  However although Carnegie claimed to be a disciple of Spencer many of his actions went against the ideas he espoused Spencerian evolution was for individual rights and against government interference Furthermore Spencerian evolution held that those unfit to sustain themselves must be allowed to perish Spencer believed that just as there were many varieties of beetles respectively modified to existence in a particular place in nature so too had human society spontaneously fallen into division of labour  103  Individuals who survived to this the latest and highest stage of evolutionary progress would be those in whom the power of selfpreservation is the greatestare the select of their generation  104  Moreover Spencer perceived governmental authority as borrowed from the people to perform the transitory aims of establishing social cohesion insurance of rights and security  105   106  Spencerian survival of the fittest firmly credits any provisions made to assist the weak unskilled poor and distressed to be an imprudent disservice to evolution  107  Spencer insisted people should resist for the benefit of collective humanity as severe fate singles out the weak debauched and disabled  107  Laissezfaire economics Andrew Carnegies political and economic focus during the late nineteenth and early twentieth century was the defense of laissezfaire economics Carnegie emphatically resisted government intrusion in commerce as well as governmentsponsored charities Carnegie believed the concentration of capital was essential for societal progress and should be encouraged  108  Carnegie was an ardent supporter of commercial survival of the fittest and sought to attain immunity from business challenges by dominating all phases of the steel manufacturing procedure  109  Carnegies determination to lower costs included cutting labor expenses as well  110  In a notably Spencerian manner Carnegie argued that unions impeded the natural reduction of prices by pushing up costs which blocked evolutionary progress  111  Carnegie felt that unions represented the narrow interest of the few while his actions benefited the entire community  109  On the surface Andrew Carnegie appears to be a strict laissezfaire capitalist and follower of Herbert Spencer  often referring to himself as a disciple of Spencer  112  Conversely Carnegie a titan of industry seems to embody all of the qualities of Spencerian survival of the fittest  The two men enjoyed a mutual respect for one another and maintained a correspondence until Spencers death in 1903  112  There are however some major discrepancies between Spencers capitalist evolutionary conceptions and Andrew Carnegies capitalist practices Market concentration Spencer wrote that in production the advantages of the superior individual are comparatively minor and thus acceptable yet the benefit that dominance provides those who control a large segment of production might be hazardous to competition Spencer feared that an absence of sympathetic selfrestraint of those with too much power could lead to the ruin of their competitors  113  He did not think freemarket competition necessitated competitive warfare Furthermore Spencer argued that individuals with superior resources who deliberately used investment schemes to put competitors out of business were committing acts of commercial murder  113  Carnegie built his wealth in the steel industry by maintaining an extensively integrated operating system Carnegie also bought out some regional competitors and merged with others usually maintaining the majority shares in the companies Over the course of twenty years Carnegies steel properties grew to include the Edgar Thomson Steel Works the Lucy Furnace Works the Union Iron Mills the Homestead Works the Keystone Bridge Works the Hartman Steel Works the Frick Coke Company and the Scotia ore mines among many other industryrelated assets  114  Herbert Spencer absolutely was against government interference in business in the form of regulatory limitations taxes and tariffs as well Spencer saw tariffs as a form of taxation that levied against the majority in service to the benefit of a small minority of manufacturers and artisans  115  Despite Carnegies personal dedication to Herbert Spencer as a friend his adherence to Spencers political and economic ideas is more contentious In particular it appears Carnegie either misunderstood or intentionally misrepresented some of Spencers principal arguments Spencer remarked upon his first visit to Carnegies steel mills in Pittsburgh which Carnegie saw as the manifestation of Spencers philosophy Six months residence here would justify suicide  116  The conditions of human society create for this an imperious demand the concentration of capital is a necessity for meeting the demands of our day and as such should not be looked at askance but be encouraged There is nothing detrimental to human society in it but much that is or is bound soon to become beneficial It is an evolution from the heterogeneous to the homogeneous and is clearly another step in the upward path of development  Carnegie Andrew 1901 The Gospel of Wealth and Other Timely Essays  108  Stainedglass window of Andrew Carnegie at the former Carnegie Library St Albans Hertfordshire Charitable institutions On the subject of charity Andrew Carnegies actions diverged in the most significant and complex manner from Herbert Spencers philosophies In his 1854 essay Manners and Fashion Spencer referred to public education as Old schemes He went on to declare that public schools and colleges fill the heads of students with inept useless knowledge and exclude useful knowledge Spencer stated that he trusted no organization of any kind political religious literary philanthropic and believed that as they expanded in influence so too did their regulations expand In addition Spencer thought that as all institutions grow they become ever more corrupted by the influence of power and money The institution eventually loses its original spirit and sinks into a lifeless mechanism  117  Spencer insisted that all forms of philanthropy that uplift the poor and downtrodden were reckless and incompetent Spencer thought any attempt to prevent the really salutary sufferings of the less fortunate bequeath to posterity a continually increasing curse  118  Carnegie a selfproclaimed devotee of Spencer  119  testified to Congress on February 5 1915 My business is to do as much good in the world as I can I have retired from all other business  120  Charity to enable people to develop Carnegie held that societal progress relied on individuals who maintained moral obligations to themselves and to society  121  Furthermore he believed that charity supplied the means for those who wish to improve themselves to achieve their goals  122  Carnegie urged other wealthy people to contribute to society in the form of parks works of art libraries and other endeavors that improve the community and contribute to the lasting good  123  Carnegie also held a strong opinion against inherited wealth Carnegie believed that the sons of prosperous businesspersons were rarely as talented as their fathers  122  By leaving large sums of money to their children wealthy business leaders were wasting resources that could be used to benefit society Most notably Carnegie believed that the future leaders of society would rise from the ranks of the poor  124  Carnegie strongly believed in this because he had risen from the bottom He believed the poor possessed an advantage over the wealthy because they receive greater attention from their parents and are taught better work ethics  124  Religion and worldview Carnegie and his family belonged to the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America  also known informally as the Northern Presbyterian Church In his early life Carnegie was skeptical of Calvinism  and religion as a whole but reconciled with it later in his life In his autobiography Carnegie describes his family as moderate Presbyterian believers writing that there was not one orthodox Presbyterian in his family various members of his family having somewhat distanced themselves from Calvinism some of them leaning more towards Swedenborgianism  While a child his family led vigorous theological and political disputes His mother avoided the topic of religion His father left the Presbyterian church after a sermon on infant damnation while according to Carnegie still remaining very religious on his own Witnessing sectarianism and strife in 19th century Scotland regarding religion and philosophy Carnegie kept his distance from organized religion and theism  125  Carnegie instead preferred to see things through naturalistic and scientific terms stating Not only had I got rid of the theology and the supernatural but I had found the truth of evolution  126  Later in life Carnegies firm opposition to religion softened For many years he was a member of Madison Avenue Presbyterian Church  pastored from 1905 to 1926 by Social Gospel exponent Henry Sloane Coffin  while his wife and daughter belonged to the Brick Presbyterian Church   127  He also prepared but did not deliver an address in which he professed a belief in an Infinite and Eternal Energy from which all things proceed  128  Records exist of a short period of correspondence around 19121913 between Carnegie and AbdulBahá  the eldest son of Baháulláh  founder of the Baháʼí Faith  In these letters one of which was published in The New York Times in full text  129  Carnegie is extolled as a lover of the world of humanity and one of the founders of Universal Peace World peace Carnegie commemorated as an industrialist philanthropist and founder of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace 1960  130  Influenced by his favorite living hero in public life John Bright  Carnegie started his efforts in pursuit of world peace at a young age  131  and supported causes that opposed military intervention   132  His motto All is well since all grows better served not only as a good rationalization of his successful business career but also his view of international relations Despite his efforts towards international peace Carnegie faced many dilemmas on his quest These dilemmas are often regarded as conflicts between his view on international relations and his other loyalties Throughout the 1880s and 1890s for example Carnegie allowed his steel works to fill large orders of armor plate for the building of an enlarged and modernized United States Navy but he opposed American overseas expansion  133  Despite that Carnegie served as a major donor for the newly established International Court of Arbitration s Peace Palace brainchild of Russian tsar Nicholas II   134  The Washington DC headquarters of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace His largest and in the long run most influential peace organization was the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace  formed in 1910 with a 10 million endowment  135  In 1913 at the dedication of the Peace Palace in The Hague Carnegie predicted that the end of the war was as certain to come and come soon as day follows night  136  In 1914 on the eve of the First World War Carnegie founded the Church Peace Union CPU a group of leaders in religion academia and politics Through the CPU Carnegie hoped to mobilize the worlds churches religious organizations and other spiritual and moral resources to join in promoting moral leadership to put an end to war forever For its inaugural international event the CPU sponsored a conference to be held on August 1 1914 on the shores of Lake Constance in southern Germany As the delegates made their way to the conference by train Germany was invading Belgium Despite its inauspicious beginning the CPU thrived Today its focus is on ethics and it is known as the Carnegie Council for Ethics in International Affairs  an independent nonpartisan nonprofit organization whose mission is to be the voice for ethics in international affairs The outbreak of the First World War was clearly a shock to Carnegie and his optimistic view on world peace Although his promotion of antiimperialism and world peace had all failed and the Carnegie Endowment had not fulfilled his expectations his beliefs and ideas on international relations had helped build the foundation of the League of Nations after his death which took world peace to another level United States colonial expansion On the matter of American colonial expansion  Carnegie had always thought it is an unwise gesture for the United States He did not oppose the annexation of the Hawaiian islands or Puerto Rico  but he opposed the annexation of the Philippines  Carnegie believed that it involved a denial of the fundamental democratic principle and he also urged William McKinley to withdraw American troops and allow the Filipinos to live with their independence  137  This act strongly impressed the other American antiimperialists who soon elected him vicepresident of the AntiImperialist League After he sold his steel company in 1901 Carnegie was able to get fully involved in the peace cause both financially and personally He gave away much of his fortunes to various peacekeeping agencies in order to keep them growing When a friend the British writer William T Stead  asked him to create a new organization for the goal of a peace and arbitration society his reply was I do not see that it is wise to devote our efforts to creating another organization Of course I may be wrong in believing that but I am certainly not wrong that if it were dependent on any millionaires money it would begin as an object of pity and end as one of derision I wonder that you do not see this There is nothing that robs a righteous cause of its strength more than a millionaires money Its life is tainted thereby  138  Carnegie believed that it is the effort and will of the people that maintains the peace in international relations Money is just a push for the act If world peace depended solely on financial support it would not seem a goal but more like an act of pity Like Stead he believed that the United States and the British Empire would merge into one nation telling him We are heading straight to the ReUnited States Carnegie believed that the combined countrys power would maintain world peace and disarmament  139  The creation of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in 1910 was regarded as a milestone on the road to the ultimate goal of abolition of war Beyond a gift of 10 million for peace promotion Carnegie also encouraged the scientific investigation of the various causes of war and the adoption of judicial methods that should eventually eliminate them He believed that the Endowment exists to promote information on the nations rights and responsibilities under existing international law and to encourage other conferences to codify this law  140  Legacy and honors Carnegie statue Dunfermline In 1899 Andrew Carnegie was awarded American Library Association Honorary Membership  Carnegie received the honorary Doctor of Laws DLL from the University of Glasgow in June 1901  141  and received the Freedom of the City of Glasgow in recognition of his munificence later the same year  142  In July 1902 he received the Freedom of the city of St Andrews  in testimony of his great zeal for the welfare of his fellowmen on both sides of the Atlantic  143  and in October 1902 the Freedom of the City of Perth in testimony of his high personal worth and beneficial influence and in recognition of widespread benefactions bestowed on this and other lands and especially in gratitude for the endowment granted by him for the promotion of University education in Scotland  144  and the Freedom of the City of Dundee   145  Also in 1902 he was elected as a member to the American Philosophical Society   146  He received an honorary Doctor of Laws LLD from the University of Aberdeen in 1906  147  In 1910 he received the Freedom of the City of Belfast  148  and was made as well Commander of the National Order of the Legion of Honour by the French government  149  Carnegie was awarded as Knight Grand Cross of the Order of OrangeNassau by Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands on August 25 1913  150  Carnegie received July 1 1914 an honorary doctorate from the University of Groningen the Netherlands  151  Mounted D carnegii or  Dippy  skeleton at the Carnegie Museum of Natural History  considered the most famous single dinosaur skeleton in the world The dinosaur Diplodocus carnegiei Hatcher was named for Carnegie after he sponsored the expedition that discovered its remains in the Morrison Formation  Jurassic  of Utah  Carnegie was so proud of Dippy that he had casts made of the bones and plaster replicas of the whole skeleton donated to several museums in Europe and South America The original fossil skeleton is assembled and stands in the Hall of Dinosaurs at the Carnegie Museum of Natural History in Pittsburgh Pennsylvania After the SpanishAmerican War  Carnegie offered to donate 20 million to the Philippines so they could buy their independence Carnegie Pennsylvania   152  and Carnegie Oklahoma  were named in his honor The Saguaro cactuss scientific name Carnegiea gigantea  is named after him The Carnegie Medal for the best childrens literature published in the UK was established in his name The Carnegie Faculty of Sport and Education at Leeds Beckett University  UK is named after him The concert halls in Dunfermline and New York are named after him At the height of his career Carnegie was the secondrichest person in the world behind only John D Rockefeller of Standard Oil  Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh was named after Carnegie who founded the institution as the Carnegie Technical Schools Carnegie Vanguard High School Lauder College named after his uncle George Lauder Sr  in the Halbeath area of Dunfermline was renamed Carnegie College in 2007 A street in Belgrade  Serbia  next to the Belgrade University Library which is one of the Carnegie libraries  is named in his honor An American high school Carnegie Vanguard High School in Houston  Texas is named after him  153  Carnegie was awarded the Freedom of the Burgh of Kilmarnock in Scotland in 1903 prior to laying the foundation stone of Loanhead Public School  154  Benefactions Andrew Carnegies cartoon throwing money in air Life  1905 According to biographer Burton J Hendrick  His benefactions amounted to 350000000for he gave away not only his annual income of something more than 12500000 but most of the principal as well Of this sum 62000000 was allotted to the British Empire and 288000000 to the United States for Carnegie in the main confined his benefactions to the Englishspeaking nations His largest gifts were 125000000 to the Carnegie Corporation of New York this same body also became his residuary legatee 60000000 to public library buildings 20000000 to colleges usually the smaller ones 6000000 to church organs 29000000 to the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching 22000000 to the Carnegie Institute of Pittsburgh 22000000 to the Carnegie Institution of Washington 10000000 to Hero Funds 10000000 to the Endowment for International Peace 10000000 to the Scottish Universities Trust 10000000 to the United Kingdom Trust and 3750000 to the Dunfermline Trust  155  Hendrick argues that These gifts fairly picture Carnegies conception of the best ways to improve the status of the common man They represent all his personal tasteshis love of books art music and natureand the reforms which he regarded as most essential to human progressscientific research education both literary and technical and above all the abolition of war The expenditure the public most associates with Carnegies name is that for public libraries Carnegie himself frequently said that his favorite benefaction was the Hero Fundamong other reasons because it came up my ain back but probably deep in his own mind his library gifts took precedence over all others in importance There was only one genuine remedy he believed for the ills that beset the human race and that was enlightenment Let there be light was the motto that in the early days he insisted on placing in all his library buildings As to the greatest endowment of all the Carnegie Corporation that was merely Andrew Carnegie in permanently organized form it was established to carry on after Carnegies death the work to which he had given personal attention in his own lifetime  156  Research sources Carnegies personal papers are at the Library of Congress Manuscript Division The Carnegie Collections of the Columbia University Rare Book and Manuscript Library consist of the archives of the following organizations founded by Carnegie The Carnegie Corporation of New York CCNY The Carnegie Endowment for International Peace CEIP the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching CFATThe Carnegie Council on Ethics and International Affairs CCEIA These collections deal primarily with Carnegie philanthropy and have very little personal material related to Carnegie Carnegie Mellon University and the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh jointly administer the Andrew Carnegie Collection of digitized archives on Carnegies life Moral appraisal April 1905 By the standards of 19thcentury tycoons Carnegie was not a particularly ruthless man but a humanitarian with enough acquisitiveness to go in the ruthless pursuit of money  157  Maybe with the giving away of his money commented biographer Joseph Wall  he would justify what he had done to get that money  158  To some Carnegie represents the idea of the American dream He was an immigrant from Scotland who came to America and became successful He is not only known for his successes but his huge amounts of philanthropic works not only for charities but also to promote democracy and independence to colonized countries  159  Works Carnegie was a frequent contributor to periodicals on labor issues Books Our Coaching Trip Brighton to Inverness 1882 An American Fourinhand in Britain 1883 Round the
