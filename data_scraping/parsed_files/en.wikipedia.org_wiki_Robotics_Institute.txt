httpwwwricmuedu The Robotics Institute RI is a division of the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh  Pennsylvania  United States  A June 2014 article in Robotics Business Review magazine calls it the worlds best robotics research facility and a pacesetter in robotics research and education  1  The Robotics Institute focuses on bringing robotics into everyday activities Its faculty members and graduate students examine a variety of fields including space robotics medical robotics industrial systems computer vision and artificial intelligence and they develop a broad array of robotics systems and capabilities  1  Established in 1979 by Raj Reddy   2  the RI was the first robotics department at any US university  3  In 1988 CMU became the first university in the world offering a PhD in Robotics In 2012 the faculty staff students and postdocs numbered over 500  3  and the RI annual budget exceeded 65M  3  making the RI one of the largest robotics research organizations in the world  4  The RI occupies facilities on the Carnegie Mellon main campus as well as in the Lawrenceville and Hazelwood neighborhoods of Pittsburgh totaling almost 200000 sq ft of indoor space and 40 acres of outdoor test facilities Major centers  edit  The National Robotics Engineering Center NREC was established in 1996 as the commercial arm of the RI with the intention of applying robotic technology to commercial and defense applications It has partnered with more than 300 companies such as General Motors  GE Ventures  Google and Apple  as well as with the US military  In September 2015 the NREC secured a 55 million gift from the car transport company Uber  to support three robotics fellowships and research directed at developing safe selfdriving cars   5  This donation was made roughly seven months after Uber poached 40 NREC scientists including its director Tony Stenz and other key program leaders while the two organizations closely collaborated on driverless technologies  6  The Field Robotics Center FRC has developed a number of significant robots including Sandstorm and H1ghlander  which finished second and third in the 2005 DARPA Grand Challenge  and Boss  which won the 2007 DARPA Grand Challenge  Media coverage and awards  edit  In his book Almost Human Making Robots Think  Lee Gutkind  7  describes the development of robots at the Robotics Institute particularly focusing on the developers and describing field testing in remote locations The robot HERB was featured in the Oreo Separator video series  8  RI robots and researchers have been featured in the Scientific American Frontiers episode Natural Born Robots  9  and in multiple NPR radio segments  10   11   12   13   14  The Advanced Robotic Laser Coating Removal System ARLCRS won a 2013 Edison Award gold award in the category of materials science processes  15  Notable faculty current and past  edit  Chris Atkeson Howie Choset Takeo Kanade Pradeep Khosla Matt Mason
