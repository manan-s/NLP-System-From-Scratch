Location Pittsburgh Pennsylvania Campus Urban Website httpwwwcbdcmuedu The Ray and Stephanie Lane Computational Biology Department CBD is one of the seven departments within the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh  Pennsylvania  United States  Now situated in the GatesHillman Center CBD was established in 2007 as the Lane Center for Computational Biology by founding department head Robert F Murphy  The establishment was supported by funding from Raymond J Lane and Stephanie Lane  1  CBD officially became a department within the School of Computer Science in 2009  2  In November 2023 Carnegie Mellon named the department as the Ray and Stephanie Lane Computational Biology Department in recognition of the Lanes significant investment in computational biology at CMU  3  CBD specializes in genomics  systems biology  and biological imaging  pioneering advanced computational methods including AI and machine learning The accolades of its faculty current and former include leadership roles such as president of the National Science Foundation  4  and the International Society of Advanced Cytometry  5  and as membership in the National Institutes of Health Council of Councils  6  They have received numerous prestigious awards including the Overton Prize   7  Guggenheim Fellowship   8  Okawa Award United States Air Force Young Investigator Award Presidential Young Investigator Award  NSF CAREER Award  Sloan Fellowship  and New Innovators Award from the NIH among others Additionally faculty members have been elected to the National Academy of Sciences   9  American Association for the Advancement of Science  and the International Society of Computational Biology  As part of the HHMINIBIB Interfaces Initiative  10  CBD received funding from Howard Hughes Medical Institute  11  and the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering NIBIB  12  to develop an interdisciplinary PhD program in computational biology with the University of Pittsburgh  which was founded as the Joint CMUPitt PhD Program in Computational Biology in 2005 This program is currently receiving training support through a National Institutes of Health T32 Training Grant CBD is the home of the BS in Computational Biology  13  one of the four BS degree programs within Carnegie Mellon School of Computer Science  The Computational Biology undergraduate program has been consistently ranked as one of the top 3 programs by US News  14  CBD is the home of an NIH Center for the HuBMAP Integration Visualization  Engaging HIVE Initiative  15  led by Ziv BarJoseph and an NIH Center for Multiscale Analysis of 4D Nucleome Structure and Function by Comprehensive Multimodal Data Integration  16  led by Jian Ma  CBD houses the Center for AIDriven Biomedical Research AI4BIO at CMU a catalyst for innovations at the intersection of AI and biomedicine across the School of Computer Science and campus  17  Notable faculty  edit
