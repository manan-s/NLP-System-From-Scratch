Jack Heinz Next Gen
Jack Heinz Next Gen is an entry point for greater involvement with the Pittsburgh Symphony. Members learn about the Symphony and promote awareness of and involvement with the PSO within their communities. It is a pipeline affiliate for the
Jack Heinz Advisory Board
—a standing committee of the Symphony Board of Directors that cultivates future leadership for the Symphony and for the Board of Directors.
Its name honors the memory of H.J. “Jack” Heinz II (1908-1987), who was president of the H.J. Heinz Company, chairman of the Howard Heinz Endowment, and visionary leader of the civic push to create Pittsburgh’s cultural district. This ambitious undertaking begin with the rebirth of the Loew’s Penn Theater as Heinz Hall, the new home of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra, in 1971.
