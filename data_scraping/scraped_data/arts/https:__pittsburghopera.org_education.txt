Learn About Opera!
Opera is a multi-faceted art form, rich in fascinating history and colorful personalities. There is always something more to learn about opera, and Pittsburgh Opera provides a wide variety of programs to help you explore individual operas and the field in general.
Education Programs at Pittsburgh Opera translate this multi-disciplinary art form into relevant, engaging, and enriching experiences for educators, students, schools, families, and adults. Pittsburgh Opera’s Education programs were recognized as a finalist at the 2019 International Opera Awards. We were the only opera company from the United States among the finalists. We invite you to join us to learn more.
More than ever, we believe that:
We all need art in our lives.
Kids need arts education to balance and enrich their learning experiences.
Pittsburgh Opera Education programs are constantly evolving to meet the needs of participants. Whether participating on Zoom or in person, we want you to enjoy learning something new about the arts.
