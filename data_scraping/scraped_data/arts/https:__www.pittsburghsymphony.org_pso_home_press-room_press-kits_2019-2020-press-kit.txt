PITTSBURGH
—(REV March 1, 2019)—Inviting audiences to   “Experience the Power of Music,” the  Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra (PSO) today announced its 2019-2020 season,  including the BNY Mellon Grand Classics Series, the PNC Pops Series, and  Special concerts.  The 2019-2020 season  will be the 12th under the direction of its Music Director Manfred  Honeck, and the 124th in the PSO’s celebrated history.
“It is invaluable to gather together for  music. It is also unforgettable to experience music with the Pittsburgh  Symphony Orchestra and Maestro Honeck as they explore the map of our humanity,”  said Melia Tourangeau, president and CEO of the Pittsburgh Symphony. “From the  opening weekend spectacular through the fabulous finale, the 2019-2020 season  is irresistible with music that is emotional and exciting.”
“This season promises to be a compelling  musical journey that will inspire and provoke Pittsburgh and audiences  beyond.  At heart, we are all humans and  need to share love, laughter, sadness and joy,” said Manfred Honeck, Music  Director of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra. “At the center of this stand-out  season is the exceptional artistry of our Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra  musicians and the power of great music to stir the soul.”
“We’re excited to introduce you to new works  and new musical voices, and to discover new ways with signature works and with  returning friends,” said Honeck. “I’m particularly looking forward to exploring  the meaning and the stories behind the music of Mozart and Beethoven, two of  the most significant and profound musical giants and visionaries.”
Experience  the Power of Music: SEASON HIGHLIGHTS
The Grammy Award-winning Pittsburgh Symphony  Orchestra will welcome many of the world's greatest artists to the Heinz Hall stage, including celebrated return and  debut guest conductors, composers and soloists. In all, the PSO will welcome  six debut artists and survey nine works across the season that will be heard in  Pittsburgh for the first time.
Artists making their debuts with the PSO next  season are:
Narek Hakhnazaryan is an Armenian cellist who  has performed with major orchestras and in recital and chamber music across  around the world. He will make his debut with the PSO and Manfred Honeck over  Thanksgiving weekend.
Seong-Jin Cho is an acclaimed pianist and  Deutsche Grammophon recording artist who regularly performs in many of the  world's most prestigious concert halls.   The South Korean pianist will join the PSO in January of 2020 to play  Liszt's Piano Concerto No. 2.
Baiba Skride is a sought-after musician by  chamber ensembles and orchestras around the world. The Latvian violinist will  play Tchaikovsky's Violin Concerto in her debut with the PSO in February of  2020.
Jakub Hrusa,  conductor, and Alina Ibragimova, violin, will each make their anticipated  debuts with the PSO in March 2020 for a program including Shostakovich's Violin  Concerto No. 1 and Brahms Symphony No. 1. Hrusa is the Chief Conductor of the  Bamberg Symphony and is a frequent guest with many of the world's greatest  orchestras. Ibragimova performs music from baroque to the present day on both  modern and period instruments.
Matthias Pintscher, conductor and composer,  will make his PSO debut leading the orchestra as well as the premiere of his  work

Mozart+: Three of the most renowned  violinists performing today each play one of the Mozart Violin Concerti, plus a  dazzling bonus piece in the Mozart+ concerts.   Audience members will experience the inventive genius, charm and whimsy  of Mozart intricately paired with brilliant companion pieces that highlight the  unique poignancy and power of Mozart to speak to modern ears.

About the  Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra
Over the last  quarter century,
MANFRED HONECK
has firmly established himself as one of  the world's leading conductors, renowned for his distinctive interpretations  and arrangements of a wide-range of repertoire. For more than a decade, Honeck  has served as Music Director of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra, continuing a  great legacy of music-making that is celebrated at home, abroad and on  recordings, including the 2018 Grammy Award for Shostakovich's Symphony No. 5  and Barber's Adagio for Strings. Since 2008, Manfred Honeck and the Pittsburgh  Symphony Orchestra have served as cultural ambassadors for the city as one of  the most frequently toured American orchestras. In addition to performing at  Carnegie Hall and Lincoln Center in New York, the orchestra regularly performs  in major European music capitals and at leading festivals such as the  Beethovenfest Bonn, BBC Proms, Musikfest Berlin, Lucerne Festival, Rheingau  Musik Festival, Grafenegg Festival and the Salzburg Festival, and continues a  close relationship with the Musikverein in Vienna. The PSO and Honeck return to  Lincoln Center in May 2019 and their next European tour takes place in fall  2019. Under Honeck's leadership of the Pittsburgh Symphony, he instituted a new  initiative to preserve the orchestra's celebrated sound, resulting in more than  a dozen recordings on the Reference and Exton labels. Together, Honeck and the  PSO have recorded symphonies by Beethoven, Bruckner, Dvořák, Mahler, and  Tchaikovsky, as well as Strauss tone poems. They have received critical acclaim  and honors from around the world, including the "Best Orchestral  Performance" Grammy Award in 2018, along with two other Grammy  nominations. Honeck has conceived of and conducted several large-scale or  operatic works as semi-staged productions for the concert hall, including Handel's  Messiah, Haydn's The Creation, and later this season in Pittsburgh he will lead  performances of Berlioz's The Damnation of Faust. Beyond the podium, he has  conceptualized and arranged a number of staged works into symphonic  "Fantasies" or "Suites," among them Janáček's Jenůfa  (Grammy nominated), Strauss's Elektra, Dvořák's Rusalka, and Tchaikovsky's ballet  Sleeping Beauty, which he frequently programs on concerts with the Pittsburgh  Symphony Orchestra, at home and on tour, as well as with orchestras throughout  the United States and abroad.
As a guest  conductor, Honeck is a regular guest with all of the major American orchestras,  including Boston, Chicago, Cleveland, Los Angeles, New York, Philadelphia and  San Francisco. He continues to appear in the world's leading concert halls and  festivals, including the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra, Berliner  Philharmoniker, Gewandhausorchester Leipzig, Staatskapelle Dresden, Royal  Concertgebouw Orchestra, London Symphony Orchestra, Orchestre de Paris,  Accademia di Santa Cecilia Rome, Vienna Philharmonic, and the Verbier Festival.  He served as Music Director of the Staatsoper Stuttgart from 2007 to 2011, and  has led operatic performances at Komische Oper Berlin, Théâtre de la Monnaie in  Brussels, Royal Opera of Copenhagen, Salzburg Festival, Semperoper Dresden and  the White Nights Festival in St. Petersburg, Russia. Born in Austria, Honeck  received his musical training at the Academy of Music in Vienna. He was a  member of the viola section of the Vienna
Philharmonic and Vienna State Opera Orchestra for eight years. Transitioning to  conducting, he began his career as an assistant to Claudio Abbado, and as  artistic leader of the Vienna Jeunesse Orchestra. He received the prestigious  European Conductor's Award in 1993 at the Zurich Opera House, and has served as  Music Director of the Norwegian National Opera, Principal Guest Conductor of  the Oslo Philharmonic Orchestra, Music Director of the Swedish Radio Symphony  Orchestra, and most recently as Principal Guest Conductor of the Czech  Philharmonic Orchestra. Honeck also has served as Artistic Director of the  International Concerts Wolfegg in Germany for more than twenty years.Manfred  Honeck has received honorary doctorates from several North American  universities. Most recently, he was awarded the honorary title of Professor by  the Austrian Federal President. An international jury of critics selected him  as the International Classical Music Awards "Artist of the Year"  2018.
The 2018 GRAMMY  Award-winning
PITTSBURGH SYMPHONY  ORCHESTRA
, known for its artistic excellence for more than 120 years, is  credited with a rich history of the world's finest conductors and musicians,  and a strong commitment to the Pittsburgh region and its citizens. Past music  directors have included Fritz Reiner (1938-1948), William Steinberg  (1952-1976), Andre Previn (1976-1984), Lorin Maazel (1984-1996) and Mariss  Jansons (1995-2004). This tradition of outstanding international music  directors was furthered in fall 2008, when Austrian conductor Manfred Honeck  became music director of the Pittsburgh Symphony. The orchestra has been at the  forefront of championing new American works and gave the first performance of  Leonard Bernstein's Symphony No. 1 "Jeremiah" in 1944 and John Adams'  Short Ride in a Fast Machine in 1986. The Pittsburgh Symphony has a long and  illustrious history in the areas of recordings and radio concerts. Its  "Pittsburgh Live!" series with Reference Recordings has resulted in  back-to-back Grammy Nominations in 2015 and 2016. As early as 1936, the  Pittsburgh Symphony broadcast on the airwaves coast-to-coast and in the late  1970s it made the ground-breaking PBS series "Previn and the  Pittsburgh." The orchestra has received increased national attention since  1982 through network radio broadcasts on Public Radio International, produced  by Classical WQED-FM 89.3, made possible by the musicians of the Pittsburgh  Symphony Orchestra. With a long and distinguished history of touring both  domestically and overseas since 1900 — including international tours to Europe,  the Far East and South America—the Pittsburgh Symphony continues to be  critically acclaimed as one of the world's greatest orchestras.
HEINZ HALL FOR THE  PERFORMING ARTS
is owned and operated by Pittsburgh Symphony, Inc., a non-profit organization,  and is the year-round home of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra. The  cornerstone of Pittsburgh's Cultural District, Heinz Hall hosts many events  that do not feature its world-renowned Orchestra including Broadway shows,  popular touring artists, comedians, speakers and much more. For a full calendar  of upcoming non-symphony events at the hall, visit heinzhall.org.
