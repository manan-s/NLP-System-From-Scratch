Our previous concert and sectionals
What's it like to be part of the program?
The opportunity to play at Heinz Hall with the PSO was amazing and also really fun! It introduced me to the basics of how professional orchestras work and gave me the opportunity to get feedback from professionals!"
I really appreciated the welcoming and comfortable environment of the Side-by-Side program. This was made possible by my great stand partner and everyone that participated in and helped run the program."
I really liked the exciting atmosphere and environment that the conductor created every time we had rehearsal."
This was one of my all-time best memories. Listening to the PSO or even rehearsing with PSO musicians can never quite replicate the astonishing feeling you get performing with world class musicians for an enthusiastic audience in a beautiful hall."
I feel much better prepared to tackle harder music and larger ensembles as my musical career continues."
In Side-by-Side, I was able to make so many friends as everyone there was driven by the same passions and had shared interests with me. It felt like people truly cared and appreciated music."
Frequently Asked Questions
Do I need to audition or submit a video?
No, there is no video or in-person audition required to participate in the Side-by-Side program. All you need is the application and teacher recommendation.
How advanced of a musician do I need to be?
Any level of musician can apply! Within the application, particular emphasis is placed on the teacher recommendation section for this reason.
Do I have to take private lessons?
No! Your teacher recommendation can be from a music teacher at school or from a private teacher.
Do I need to be accepted into a music program after high school to apply?
Not at all! Side-by-Side is for all high school student musicians, regardless of your plans after high school. You just have to be in grades 9-12, play an instrument, and love music!
