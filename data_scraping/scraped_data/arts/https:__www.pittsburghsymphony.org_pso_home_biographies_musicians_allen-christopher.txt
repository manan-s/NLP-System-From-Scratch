Christopher Allen
Associate Principal Timpani & Percussion
Christopher Allen joined the Pittsburgh Symphony percussion section in September of 1997. Born and raised on Long Island, he began his serious musical training at The Juilliard School Pre-College division where he studied for four years. After that he attended the Curtis Institute of Music, and then pursued graduate studies at Temple University.
During his final three seasons in Philadelphia, Christopher Allen  performed as a percussionist in the Philadelphia Orchestra. In 1983 he was appointed principal timpanist in the Columbus Symphony Orchestra, where he remained until coming to Pittsburgh. During two of his seasons in Columbus, he took time off to return to performing as a percussionist in the Philadelphia Orchestra. Allen also spent eight summers playing in the Grand Teton Music Festival—four years in the percussion section and four years as timpanist. Mr. Allen teaches percussion at Duquesne University.
