Join the Pittsburgh Opera Family and play a leading role when you
become a monthly donor
!
Why give monthly?
1.
Consistent Support
: Monthly, sustaining giving allows you to make a gift that fits into your budget and provides Pittsburgh Opera with a stable, predictable source of funding. We can focus on creating the music while you focus on enjoying it!
2.
Convenience and Flexibility
: Monthly giving is hassle-free. Once you set up your recurring donation, your contribution will be automatically deducted from your chosen payment method each month. You have full control over the amount you give, and you can easily adjust, pause, or stop your donation at any time.
3.
Deeper Impact
: Your monthly gift accumulates over time to make a significant impact and can easily add up to a
substantial annual contribution
. This allows us to both budget our resources more efficiently.
4.
Community of Supporters
: You join a group of creative individuals who share a passion for opera and the arts. Connect with fellow supporters and be part of a vibrant network that celebrates the transformational power of the performing arts.
Join us today!
