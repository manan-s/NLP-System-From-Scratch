Philip Pandolfi
Bassoon
Born in Boston and raised in Milwaukee and St. Louis, bassoonist Philip Pandolfi has been a member of the Pittsburgh Symphony since 1995. After undergraduate studies at Indiana University and a Master's degree from Temple University, Philip was selected from over one thousand applicants for the inaugural season of the New World Symphony, in 1988. He spent three seasons in the Miami-based ensemble, performing in the United States, South America and Europe.
Prior to his appointment in the Pittsburgh Symphony, Philip spent two seasons each in the Montreal Symphony and the Florida Orchestra (Tampa). He has also performed with the Cleveland, Chicago, Minnesota and St. Louis Symphony orchestras. He has been Principal Bassoonist of the Peninsula Music Festival in Door County, Wisconsin since 1998.
A busy chamber musician in Miami, Tampa and Montreal, Philip has performed with the Pittsburgh Chamber Music Project, the Shadyside Concert Series, and on numerous faculty recitals at Duquesne and Carnegie Mellon universities.
