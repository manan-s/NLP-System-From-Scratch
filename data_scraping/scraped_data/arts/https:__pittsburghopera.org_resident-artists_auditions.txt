Each year, exceptional singers from around the world are selected to enter the program through live auditions in Cincinnati, New York City, and Pittsburgh, and since 2020, through a virtual audition option. Each applicant must demonstrate significant operatic potential and thorough musical and theatrical training.

RESIDENT ARTIST FAQ
Download a PDF of this FAQ here.
Who is on the audition panel?
Christopher Hahn, General Director; Robert Boldin, Director of Artistic Operations; Mark Trawka, Director of Musical Studies.
Is there an age limit to participate in Pittsburgh Opera’s Resident Artist Program?
There is not an official age limit, but most of our Resident Artists are in their 20’s and early 30’s. Singers are more likely to be granted an audition if they are about to or have recently completed formal academic training, but this is not a requirement to be considered for the program.
Do I need to be a U.S. citizen to attend the program?
Pittsburgh Opera will not apply for a visa on your behalf. If you have a current visa that will allow you to work in the United States for the full two-year program, we encourage you to apply.
What do I need to record? Do you have any guidance on how to record my selections?
Applicants are required to submit two (2) video recordings of selections in contrasting styles and languages recording within the last six months. One must be an opera aria; one may be a performance recording, if desired. Recordings may be made with either live accompaniment or a pre-recorded track.

If I’m granted a virtual audition, what do I need to record?
Applicants who are granted a virtual audition will be required to record and submit two selections in one continuous video recording (without stopping the camera). This video MUST be recorded on or after September 4, 2024.
Repertoire for video auditions will be selected by the singer. We strongly recommend submitting contrasting selections, and preferably ones that you did not submit with your original application. Guidelines for repertoire selection and video production will be provided.
The deadline for submitting a virtual audition video is
November 15, 2024
.
What if I need to change my live audition date/time?
First, you should try to find a colleague who is willing to switch with you. Once you have made the switch, e-mail Matthew Hrdlicka, Artistic Coordinator, to notify him of the change. If you cannot make the switch yourself, please contact
Matthew Hrdlicka
and best efforts will be made to accommodate your request.
If I need to cancel my live audition, can I submit virtual audition materials instead?
If you need to cancel your live audition but would like to be considered virtually, please contact

If you are selected for a virtual audition, you will sing two arias of your choice.
What if I don’t know an aria in every language requested?
You should sing the arias you are most comfortable performing.
What if I want to change my audition repertoire?
If you are selected for a live audition, you may update your repertoire at any time via YAP Tracker or submit a new repertoire list at the time of your audition. Virtual applicants selected for the second round will be required to re-submit a repertoire list for consideration by the panel.
What materials do I need to bring for the audition panel?
The panel will have all materials submitted with your application. If you have an updated repertoire list or resume, you may submit it to the monitor at the time of your audition.
Is there a place to warm-up before my audition?
Warm-up space is limited and not guaranteed depending on the location. Please come to the audition prepared to sing.

When are casting decisions made?
