PITTSBURGH SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA ANNOUNCES 2023-2024 SEASON: EXPERIENCE THE POWER OF NOW
Classical season offers “New Perspectives” welcoming dozens of new artists, plus commissions and premieres; “Once Upon a Time” musical journeys that are inspired by some of the most imaginative stories of all time; and a focus on groundbreaking female artists and composers from around the world
Pops season travels across musical genres as diverse as rock ‘n’ roll, Broadway, soul and R&B, the Great American Songbook, holiday favorites, and Hollywood movies
PITTSBURGH—
Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra Music Director Manfred Honeck, Principal Pops Conductor Byron Stripling
and
president and CEO Melia Tourangeau
today announced the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra’s 2023-2024 season, inviting audiences to “Experience the power of NOW.” The 2023-2024 season will be the 128th in the storied history of the Orchestra, the sixth oldest major orchestra in the United States. Subscriptions to BNY Mellon Grand Classics are available now, and subscriptions to PNC Pops will be available in early March.
“The 2023-2024 season has the power to embrace this moment with soul-stirring performances that are deeply relevant to our time, and that connect intimately with our humanity. When played with the passion of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra musicians and led by our exceptional Music Director Manfred Honeck and Principal Pops Conductor Byron Stripling, music has the power to transform our lives in earth-shattering ways,”
said Melia Tourangeau, president and CEO of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra
. “There is no time like now to see and hear one of the world’s greatest orchestras in what promises to be a deeply engaging season with widely diverse artists, composers, treasured favorites and bold new works.”
The Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra’s 2023-2024 BNY Mellon Grand Classics season
will be the 16th under the direction of
Music Director Manfred Honeck
, internationally admired for his revelatory interpretations. The 2023-2024 season continues the Pittsburgh Symphony’s tradition of introducing to the Pittsburgh community for the first time many exciting artists and new works, which next season will have four world premieres, 12 Pittsburgh premieres and nine outstanding soloists and conductors performing with the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra in their highly anticipated debuts at Heinz Hall. Throughout the season, Manfred Honeck will lead 10 wide ranging programs on the BNY Mellon Grand Classics subscription series, collaborating with many of the world’s leading classical musicians, including the Pittsburgh debuts of five artists, and the performances of 11 of the premieres and commissions. The 2023-2024 season marks BNY Mellon’s 23rd consecutive year as title sponsor of the series.
“Music at its heart is really about life—our shared experiences of disappointments and triumphs, of the pain of darkness and the hopefulness of light, of our deep connections with one another. To me, music is the most dynamic form of art with an unforgettable connection between the orchestra and the audience that unfolds in real time with intensity and excitement,”
said Manfred Honeck, Music Director of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra
. “The music, composers and artists of the 2023-2024 season both speak to our times and offer us the possibility to spend time together on an unforgettable musical journey, with old friends and new.”
The Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra’s 2023-2024 PNC Pops subscription season
will be the fourth under the direction of Principal Pops Conductor Byron Stripling, internationally known both as a conductor and virtuoso trumpet player. The season will include programs that cross genres as diverse as rock ‘n’ roll, Broadway, soul and R&B, the Great American Songbook, holiday favorites, and Hollywood movies. Byron Stripling and outstanding guest conductors will welcome soloists who are bright stars of the stage (including a group of amazing circus performers) who will bring to life magical melodies, the biggest hits, and soul-touching classics. Stripling will lead three subscription concert weekends, and the season will feature a special concert version of “Fiddler on the Roof,” in collaboration with the Pittsburgh CLO. The 2023-2024 season marks PNC’s 23rd consecutive year as title sponsor of the series. The 2023-2024 season will mark the 16th year for Highmark Blue Cross Blue Shield as title sponsor of Holiday Pops. Popular specials and films with orchestra will also return next season and be announced later this year.
“There is nothing like music to fill our hearts with love and joy. The range of great popular music is simply astonishing, from show tunes to soul to film themes to lighter classics. When it’s arranged for orchestra and played by the Pittsburgh Symphony, and sung by stars of the stage, it will simply take your breath away,”
said Byron Stripling, Principal Pops Conductor of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra
. “The 2023-2024 pops season will bring us all together for music that you might already love, and plenty of cool new music and artists for you to discover and experience. This is the music that lifts us up, and that makes for a deeply enjoyable time together.”
