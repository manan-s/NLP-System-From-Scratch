Featured Recipe: Pickled Red Onions
Pickled Red Onions
From Emily Catalano of
GoodFoodPittsburgh.com
With their signature pink brine color, pickled red onions are an easy dish to add spice and flavor to any meal. Try in place of normal red onions, although these go particularly well on top of spicy tacos or decadent burgers.
1 red onion, thinly sliced
1 1/2 cup white vinegar
2 Tbsp. sugar
1 Tbsp. kosher salt
1 clove peeled garlic
1 Tsp. peppercorns
Place the vinegar in a small saucepan, and heat until boiling. Add salt and sugar, stir to dissolve. Place sliced red onions, peeled garlic and peppercorns in a sterilized jar, and pack onions in tightly. Add the hot liquid to the jar, cover and leave to cool to room temperature. Once cool, cover tightly and refrigerate. Use within one month.
