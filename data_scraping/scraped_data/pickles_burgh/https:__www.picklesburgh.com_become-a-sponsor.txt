Become a Sponsor
Due to the plethora of experiences available, pedestrian traffic is on the rise on the evenings and weekends in Downtown Pittsburgh. Events like Picklesburgh add to that traffic and pull audiences into Downtown from surrounding suburbs.
We are no stranger to putting on successful events in Downtown Pittsburgh. We drive attendance through a variety of communications channels.
Through our social media presence on Twitter (over 97,000 followers), Facebook (over 24,000 likes), and Instagram (over 47,000 followers) we inform followers of upcoming events and provide visibility and engagement opportunities for our sponsors.
As a result of marketing through traditional, digital, and earned media channels, we anticipate attendance of 100,000+ for the three-day event.
