10 Things to Do on Pittsburgh's Three Rivers
Your guide to getting out on Pittsburgh's iconic Three Rivers
The three rivers that run through our city make for a beautiful photo backdrop no matter the season, but from early spring until the middle of fall, we invite you to get out onto the rivers yourself!
From riverboats and kayaks to tikis, pontoons and even a submarine, enjoy the views and explore our city’s waterways with these unique Pittsburgh aquatic adventures!

A Quick River Primer
Before you head out on your river trek, be sure you know your rivers. The Allegheny (pronunciations phonetically below) divides Downtown and the Northside of the city, the Monongahela (you can always just call this The Mon and sound like a local) divides Downtown and the Southside, and the Ohio starts where the other two meet at the Point. Now, try guessing how we pronounce North Versailles.

1) Gateway Clipper
Climb aboard a member of the
Gateway Clipper
Fleet for an unforgettable tour around the city. Offering dining cruises, sightseeing cruises, kids themed cruises, private events (I've had multiple school dances and weddings aboard this fleet), these riverboats sail across the shores of Downtown allowing guests to get the best views of PNC Park, Acrisure Stadium and the Point State Park fountain!
2) Boat Charters & Rentals
Let Captain Bob Rush take the wheel and your group on a chauffeured pleasure cruise for you and up to six passengers with
Rush Hour Boat Charter
. Cruises go for two hours throughout the day, plus sunset cruises are available as well as sailgating before and during massive concerts in the Burgh.
Look at me. Are you the captain now? Chart your own course through
Pittsburgh Boat Rental
! Rent an 18’ party barge that seats nine or pontoon boat that seats eight and cruise around to get one of a kind views of the city. Rentals are available from sunrise to sunset for fun with friends and family in 3-, 4- or 8-hour time slots.

3) Kayak Pittsburgh
Paddle through the Three Rivers with
Kayak Pittsburgh
! Soak up the sun and the
Downtown city views
solo, grab a friend for a tandem kayak through
Sharpsburg
or take a relaxing pedal boat through
North Park Lake
. Also, be sure to look for
special trips
including guided tours, their paddle & pints series with a craft beer flair and introductions to kayak fishing. These rentals are fantastic for families, date day trips and large groups who love being active!
Pro-Tip: I love to start my kayak rental and head upstream while I'm still full of energy, then gently float back to shore on my return trip and enjoy the views.

4) Cruisin' Tikis
Forget that
trip to the islands
and set sail on a Hawaiian-style tiki boat cruise through the city’s water ways with five of your closest family or friends! On your tropical daycation, spend two hours leisurely floating around the city’s rivers in a tiki hut equipped with Bluetooth speakers. Crusin’ Tikis has brought the tropics to the city of champions!
Be sure to BOOK IN ADVANCE. These trips sell out weeks in advance, especially in the summer months.
Pro Tip: Bigger group? Two boats can be tied together to suit your party of up to 12.
5) Rivers of Steel
Temporarily Suspended. Check back for updates.
All aboard!
Rivers of Steel
offers sightseeing tours, corporate charters and student education aboard the world's first green passenger riverboat. The
Uniquely Pittsburgh Sightseeing Tour
explores what makes Pittsburgh so special historically and how the city’s residents and workers are shaping this dynamic city all while cruising through its rivers! The best part? Proceeds from the tour aid student STEM education programs.
Pro Tip: Look for special events on their website like the
Birdwatching Cruise
with the
National Aviary
in the summer and
The Hardest Working River Tour
in October for uniquely Pittsburgh experiences.
6) Pittsburgh Party Pontoons
You can see the distinct black and gold-painted
Pittsburgh Party Pontoons
daily in our three rivers hosting birthdays, team buildings, bachelor/bachelorette parties and anything else you can think of! BYOB, snacks and up to 18 guests for this 1 hour 45-minute tour of the city!
Pedal boats
seating 14 can also be rented here to keep your friends and loved ones active between sips.

7) Steel City Jet Skis
Have that need for speed? Adrenaline junkies can see the best of our three rivers blur by as you go from Sharpsburg to the Point on these
thrilling jet skis
. Passengers ride for free, so your rental can easily accommodate you and another guest or you and two kids.
Pro Tip: There's a no wake zone in effect near the Point from Friday afternoon until early Monday, so book your trip during the weekday so you never have to let up on the throttle.

8) USS Requin at the Carnegie Science Center
Ok, so the
submarine doesn't go anywhere
, but that doesn't make this stop any less essential to being a Pittsburgher. Come on board (admission is included with your Carnegie Science Center ticket), head below decks and discover how 80 men served on this WW2-era sub that you can explore from the torpedo room up front to the stern room in the back.
9) Dragon Boat Racing
The ancient tradition of
Dragon Boat Racing
(going back more than 2,000 years) has finally made its way to our rivers! The Steel City Dragons offer a free paddling lesson and introduction to the sport at the Fox Chapel Yacht Club. Dragon boats are propelled by 20 paddlers all moving to the beat of a drummer sitting in the front while a steerer keeps the dragon boat on course.

10) Whitewater Rafting
Looking to conquer the rapids?
White Water Adventures
or
Laurel Highlands River Tours
in Ohiopyle State Park (about an hour south of Pittsburgh) have you covered with a variety of whitewater courses based on difficulty.
