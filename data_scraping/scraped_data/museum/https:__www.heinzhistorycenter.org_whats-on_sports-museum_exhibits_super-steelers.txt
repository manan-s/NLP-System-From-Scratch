Super Steelers
Discover the history behind the Steelers dynasty and celebrate the team’s six Super Bowl championships.
Professional football traces its roots to Pittsburgh when in 1892, the Allegheny Athletic Association football team paid former Yale University All-American
guard
Pudge William “Pudge” Heffelfinger $500 to play against the Pittsburgh Athletic Club. Forty years later, Art Rooney Sr. founded Pittsburgh’s first professional franchise, first known as the Pirates and later renamed the Steelers. Today, the Steelers’ six Super Bowl trophies are tied for the most among any NFL team, helping to secure an unmatched legacy of professional football in Pittsburgh.
The Home of the Immaculate Reception
The Western Pennsylvania Sports Museum is the home of the Immaculate Reception year-round and features a lifelike figure of Franco Harris making the catch, Harris’ cleats from the play, the Three Rivers Stadium field turf where it happened, as well as other 1970s Steelers artifacts.

He scored the first of two touchdowns in the Steelers’ 16-6 victory and was named Most Valuable Player. This ring, on display in the Sports Museum, was made by Jostens for the franchise’s first Super Bowl victory.
