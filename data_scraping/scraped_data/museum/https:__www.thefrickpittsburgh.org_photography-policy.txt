Photography Policy
Still photography without flash for private, non-commercial use by means of phones, hand-held cameras and tablet devices, is permitted only in the permanent collection galleries of The Frick Art Museum and Car and Carriage Museum, provided 18” distance is maintained from any art or artifacts. Personal photography is also permitted at the Greenhouse, and on the grounds of The Frick Pittsburgh. Photography is prohibited inside the historic mansion, Clayton, and is not allowed in specified special exhibition galleries at The Frick Art Museum. Selfie sticks are permitted outside on the grounds, but not indoors. Videography and use of a tripod or other camera equipment is not permitted at any time. Photographs cannot be published, sold, reproduced, or otherwise commercially exploited in any manner whatsoever. The Frick Pittsburgh is not responsible for any uses of visitor photography that infringe upon third-party copyrights or other rights. Visitors taking photos are asked to please be courteous to other museum visitors by not blocking their view or impeding their movement.
