Service Animal Policy
Service animals are always welcome at the Heinz History Center, Fort Pitt Museum, and the Meadowcroft Rockshelter and Historic Village.
Dogs are the only animals recognized as service animals by federal and state law. Service animals are individually trained to do work or perform tasks for people with disabilities and must be under control at all times by the owner. Service animals must be harnessed, leashed, or tethered, unless these devices interfere with the service animal’s work or the individual’s disability prevents using these devices. In that case, the individual must maintain control of the animal through voice, signal, or other effective controls. The owner of a service animal may be asked to remove the animal from the premises if they do not take effective action to control the animal.
The Heinz History Center, Fort Pitt Museum, and the Meadowcroft Rockshelter and Historic Village abide by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) definition of service animals. However, animals such as “comfort animals,” “therapy animals,” “companion animals” or “emotional support animals” are not service animals as defined by the ADA, because they are not trained to perform a specific task for an individual with a disability. Therefore, these animals are not permitted entry into our family of museums.
