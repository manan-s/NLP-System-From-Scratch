The Car and Carriage Museum
At the turn of the 20th century, the development of the automobile profoundly changed American life. In the Car and Carriage Museum, visitors can travel back to the time of horse-drawn carriages, see some of the first horseless carriages to have an impact on Pittsburgh, and learn about Pittsburgh’s role in the developing automobile industry. The Car and Carriage Museum houses the Frick's collection of historic carriages and automobiles dating back to the turn of the 20th century. The museum also hosts temporary exhibitions.
Enhance your visit with a free guided tour of the Car and Carriage Museum. Tours are held at
1 p.m.
and
3 p.m.
on Wednesdays and Saturdays.
