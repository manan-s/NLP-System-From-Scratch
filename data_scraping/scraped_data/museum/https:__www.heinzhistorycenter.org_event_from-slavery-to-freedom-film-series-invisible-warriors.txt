Join the African American Program for a free virtual screening of “Invisible Warriors: African American Women in World War II.”
Presented as part of the From Slavery to Freedom Film Series, “Invisible Warriors: African American Women in World War II” follows a small group of women who embrace new career opportunities working in factories to support the war efforts during World War II and their impact on society.
“Invisible Warriors: African American Women in World War II” discusses African American women’s role in supporting WWII.
During WWII, more women began to enter the workforce and became known as Rosie the Riveter to support war efforts at home. Opportunities to work in factories and government contracts opened. African American women fought for racial and gender equality in the newly created positions. Hearing from the women, a new image of who Rosie the Riveter emerges.
Gregory S. Cooke, historian and director of “Invisible Warriors,” will join the broadcast following the screening to discuss the film.
Admission
The virtual screening is free with advance registration.
