Carnegie Museum of Art
Carnegie Museum of Art was the first museum in the United States with a strong focus on contemporary art, instructed by its founder, Andrew Carnegie, to collect the “old masters of tomorrow” at the inception of the Carnegie International in 1896. Today, it’s one of the most dynamic major art institutions in the country.
Carnegie Museum of Natural History
As one of the country’s largest and most respected natural history museums, Carnegie Museum of Natural History plays a critical role in both the Pittsburgh region and the international scientific community by conducting research and presenting exhibitions and programs that highlight the interdependence of humanity and nature, and advocating for the protection of the earth and its inhabitants. The museum’s millions of objects and specimens form one of the world’s great archives of biodiversity and the history of life.
Carnegie Science Center
Recognized as a national leader in promoting literacy in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM), Carnegie Science Center is dedicated to nurturing the next generation of innovators and leaders who will rise to meet tomorrow’s workforce needs. Already the region’s most visited museum with more than 500,000 annual visitors, the Science Center’s new PPG Science Pavilion, to be completed in 2018, is expected to double the number of students it reaches.
The Andy Warhol Museum
The most comprehensive single-artist museum in the world, The Andy Warhol Museum illuminates the art, life, and times of one of the most influential American artists of the 20th century. Combining artworks, images, and objects from Warhol's colorful life, the museum takes visitors on a tour of Andy Warhol's personal and professional life—from Andy Warhol the Pittsburgh art student to Andy Warhol the Pop icon. With some 500,000 artworks and objects, the museum is the global keeper of Warhol's legacy.
