The Frick Art Museum
Designed by Pittsburgh architects Pratt, Schafer & Slowik, the Italian Renaissance-style Frick Art Museum was built by founder Helen Clay Frick to house her collection of fine and decorative arts, as well as paintings, sculpture and porcelains that she had inherited from her father. Strengths of the collection include French 18th-century painting and decorative arts, early Italian Renaissance painting, Renaissance and Baroque bronzes, and extraordinary Chinese porcelains.

The Frick Art Museum was opened in 1970 to house Helen Clay Frick’s personal collection of fine and decorative arts, which has particularly outstanding examples of early-Renaissance Sienese painting, and 18th-century French painting, furniture, and decorative arts. The Museum was designed to exhibit the collection in an atmosphere of intimacy.
Highlights of the permanent collection include a portrait by Rubens, a pastoral scene by Boucher, and Italian panel paintings by Giovanni di Paolo and Sassetta.
The museum also hosts an ongoing schedule of traveling exhibitions and related lectures, tours and workshops.
