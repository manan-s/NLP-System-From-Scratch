Pittsburgh, the second-largest city in the U.S. state of Pennsylvania, is home to over 125 completed high-rise buildings of at least 115 feet (35 m), 32 of which exceed 300 feet (91 m). The tallest building in Pittsburgh is the 64-story U.S. Steel Tower, which rises 841 feet (256 m), was completed in 1970, and is also the fifth tallest building in Pennsylvania. The second-tallest skyscraper in the city is BNY Mellon Center, which rises 725 feet (221 m).
The history of skyscrapers in Pittsburgh began with the 1895 completion of the Carnegie Building; this structure, rising 13 floors, was the first steel-framed skyscraper to be constructed in the city. It never held the title of tallest structure in the city, however, as it did not surpass the 249-foot (76 m) tower of the Allegheny County Courthouse, which was completed in 1888. The Carnegie Building was later demolished in 1952 to make way for an expansion of a Kaufmann's (now Burlington) department store. Pittsburgh experienced a large building boom from the late 1960s to the late 1980s. During this time, 11 of the city's 20 tallest buildings were constructed, including the city's three tallest structures, the U.S. Steel Tower, BNY Mellon Center, and PPG Place. As of January 2020 the entire city had 10 completed skyscrapers that rise at least 492 feet (150 m), which ranks Pittsburgh's skyline 14th in the United States and 90th in the world, with two skyscrapers exceeding 700 feet (213 m).
Unlike many other major American cities, Pittsburgh was the site of relatively few skyscraper construction projects in the first two decades of the 21st century. Only two skyscrapers over 300 feet (91 m) have been completed since 2000. The 361-foot (110 m) Three PNC Plaza was completed in 2010, and the 545-foot (166 m) Tower at PNC Plaza was completed in 2015, making it the city's most recently completed skyscraper. Overall, as of September, 2022, there is one high-rise building over 300 feet (91 m) under construction, the FNB Financial Center.
